The cumulative effect of these impacts on global capacity of coral reefs to provide ecosystem services is unknown. Here, we evaluate global changes in extent of coral reef habitat, coral reef fishery catches and effort, Indigenous consumption of coral reef fishes, and coral-reef-associated biodiversity. Global coverage of living coral has declined by half since the 1950s. Catches of coral-reef-associated fishes peaked in 2002 and are in decline despite increasing fishing effort, and catch-per-unit effort has decreased by 60% since 1950. At least 63% of coral-reef-associated biodiversity has declined with loss of coral extent. With projected continued degradation of coral reefs and associated loss of biodiversity and fisheries catches, the well-being and sustainable coastal development of human communities that depend on coral reef ecosystem services are threatened.","[Eddy, Tyler D.; Lam, Vicky W.

Given cities' heterogeneity, they need specific low-carbon roadmaps instead of one-size-fits-all approaches. Here, we present the most detailed and up-to-date accounts of CO2 emissions for 294 cities in China and examine the extent to which their economic growth was decoupled from emissions. Results show that from 2005 to 2015, only 11% of cities exhibited strong decoupling, whereas 65.6% showed weak decoupling, and 23.4% showed no decoupling. We attribute the economic-emission decoupling in cities to several socioeconomic factors (i.e., structure and size of the economy, emission intensity, and population size) and find that the decline in emission intensity via improvement in production and carbon efficiency (e.g., decarbonizing the energy mix via building a renewable energy system) is the most important one. The experience and status quo of carbon emissions and emission-GDP (gross domestic product) decoupling in Chinese cities may have implications for other developing economies to design low-carbon development pathways.","[Shan, Yuli; Hubacek, Klaus] Univ Groningen, Energy & Sustainabil Res Inst Groningen, Integrated Res Energy Environm & Soc IREES, NL-9747 AG Groningen, Netherlands; [Fang, Shuai] Univ Groningen, Dept Econ Geog, NL-9747 AD Groningen, Netherlands; [Cai, Bofeng] Chinese Acad Environm Planning, Ctr Climate & Environm Policy, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Ya] Guangdong Univ Technol, Inst Environm & Ecol Engn, Key Lab City Cluster Environm Safety & Green Dev, Minist Educ, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China; [Li, Dong] Beijing Tsinghua Tongheng Urban Planning & Design, Innovat Ctr Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Feng, Kuishuang] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University of Groningen; University of Groningen; Guangdong University of Technology; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Shan, YL; Hubacek, K (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Energy & Sustainabil Res Inst Groningen, Integrated Res Energy Environm & Soc IREES, NL-9747 AG Groningen, Netherlands.;Cai, BF (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Environm Planning, Ctr Climate & Environm Policy, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China.;Zhou, Y (corresponding author), Guangdong Univ Technol, Inst Environm & Ecol Engn, Key Lab City Cluster Environm Safety & Green Dev, Minist Educ, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China.",y.shan@rug.nl; caibf@caep.org.cn; yazhou@gdut.edu.cn; k.hubacek@rug.nl,"Zhou, Ya/GLV-3914-2022; Feng, Kuishuang/Y-2541-2019; Shan, Yuli/ABE-6011-2020; Shan, Yuli/N-7747-2015; Li, Dong/AAS-4493-2020; Hubacek, Klaus/K-3500-2019; Hubacek, Klaus/GVS-6444-2022","Zhou, Ya/0000-0002-1960-8900; Shan, Yuli/0000-0002-5215-8657; Li, Dong/0000-0002-7527-5645; Fang, Shuai/0000-0002-3108-1072; Hubacek, Klaus/0000-0003-2561-6090","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71673107, 71704029]; Humanities and Social Science Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China [16YJCZH162]; Czech Science Foundation under the project VEENEX (GACR) [1617978S]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanities and Social Science Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Czech Science Foundation under the project VEENEX (GACR)","B.C. was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71673107), and Y.Z. was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71704029) and the Humanities and Social Science Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China (16YJCZH162).

We present an algorithmic corpus comparison and machine-learning topic model of 180 ExxonMobil climate change communications, including peer-reviewed publications, internal company documents, and advertorials in The New York Times. We also investigate advertorials using inductive frame analysis. We find that the company has publicly overemphasized some terms and topics while avoiding others. Most notably, they have used rhetoric of climate risk and consumer energy demand to construct a Fossil Fuel Savior (FFS) frame that downplays the reality and seriousness of climate change, normalizes fossil fuel lock-in, and individualizes responsibility. These patterns mimic the tobacco industry's documented strategy of shifting responsibility away from corporations-which knowingly sold a deadly product while denying its harms-and onto consumers. This historical parallel foreshadows the fossil fuel industry's use of demand-as-blame arguments to oppose litigation, regulation, and activism.","[Supran, Geoffrey; Oreskes, Naomi] Harvard Univ, Dept Hist Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Supran, G (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Dept Hist Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",gjsupran@fas.harvard.edu,,"Supran, Geoffrey/0000-0002-3846-1633",Harvard University Faculty Development Funds; Rockefeller Family Fund,Harvard University Faculty Development Funds; Rockefeller Family Fund,"This research was supported by Harvard University Faculty Development Funds and by the Rockefeller Family Fund.

Nature-based solutions (NbS) are gaining traction in science and policy, but their potential for transformative change remains unexplored. We provide a framework to evaluate how NbS contribute to transformative change and apply it to 93 NbS from mountain social-ecological systems (SES). The framework serves to assess what elements may catalyze transformative change, how transformative change occurs, and what its outcomes are. Our results show that NbS are as much people based'' as nature based.'' Most NbS are based on four elements with transformation poten-tial: nature's values, knowledge types, community engagement, and nature management practices. Our results confirm the potential of NbS for transformative change, observed through changes in non-sustainable trajectories of SES. We illustrate the components of our framework through a novel classification of NbS. The framework provides key components for assessing the effectiveness of NbS and allows tracking long-term transformative change processes.","[Palomo, Ignacio; Bruley, Enora; Lavorel, Sandra] CNRS UGA USMB, Lab Ecol Alpine, UMR 5553, CS 40700, F-38058 Grenoble 9, France; [Palomo, Ignacio; Pascual, Unai; Zafra-Calvo, Noelia] Univ Basque Country, Basque Ctr Climate Change, Sci Campus, Bilbao 48940, Spain; [Locatelli, Bruno] Univ Montpellier, Cirad, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Locatelli, Bruno] Cifor, Lima 15024, Peru; [Otero, Iago] Univ Lausanne, Interdisciplinary Ctr Mt Res, Campus Sion,Chemin Inst 18, CH-1967 Bramois, Switzerland; [Colloff, Matthew] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Crouzat, Emilie] Univ Grenoble Alpes, LESSEM, INRAE, F-38402 St Martin Dheres, France; [Cuni-Sanchez, Aida] Univ York, York Inst Trop Ecosyst, Dept Environm & Geog, Wentworth Way, York YO10 5NG, N Yorkshire, England; [Cuni-Sanchez, Aida; Gomez-Baggethun, Erik] Norwegian Univ Life Sci NM BU, Fac Landscape & Soc, Dept Int Environm & Dev Studies Noragric, POB 5003, N-1432 As, Norway; [Gomez-Baggethun, Erik] Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, Sognsveien 68, N-0855 Oslo, Norway; [Gonzalez-Garcia, Alberto] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Ecol, Social Ecol Syst Lab, Edificio Biol,C Darwin 2, Madrid 28049, Spain; [Gret-Regamey, Adrienne] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Planning Landscape & Urban Syst, Stefano Franscini Pl 5, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Jimenez-Aceituno, Amanda] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Martin-Lopez, Berta] Leuphana Univ, Fac Sustainabil, Social Ecol Syst Inst 5E51, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany; [Pascual, Unai] Ikerbasque Basque Fdn Sci, Plaza Euskadi 5, Bilbao 48009, Spain; [Pascual, Unai] Univ Bern, Ctr Dev & Environm, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Fischborn, Marie] IUCN, Global Protected Areas Programme, CH-1196 Gland, Switzerland; [Metz, Rosmarie] GIZ, Div Climate Change Rural Dev Infrastruct, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Savoie; Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3); University of Basque Country; CIRAD; Universite de Montpellier; CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR); University of Lausanne; Australian National University; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); INRAE; N8 Research Partnership; White Rose University Consortium; University of York - UK; Norwegian University of Life Sciences; Norwegian Institute Nature Research; Autonomous University of Madrid; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Stockholm University; Leuphana University Luneburg; Basque Foundation for Science; University of Bern,"Palomo, I (corresponding author), CNRS UGA USMB, Lab Ecol Alpine, UMR 5553, CS 40700, F-38058 Grenoble 9, France.;Palomo, I (corresponding author), Univ Basque Country, Basque Ctr Climate Change, Sci Campus, Bilbao 48940, Spain.",ignacio.palomo@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr,"PASCUAL, UNAI/B-4766-2012; Locatelli, Bruno/C-9957-2009; PALOMO, IGNACIO/D-4398-2014; Martin-Lopez, Berta/R-9397-2017; Grêt-Regamey, Adrienne/HPE-6858-2023; Grêt-Regamey, Adrienne/AAZ-7546-2021","PASCUAL, UNAI/0000-0002-5696-236X; Locatelli, Bruno/0000-0003-2983-1644; PALOMO, IGNACIO/0000-0002-4573-5989; Martin-Lopez, Berta/0000-0003-2622-0135; Grêt-Regamey, Adrienne/0000-0001-8156-9503; Grêt-Regamey, Adrienne/0000-0001-8156-9503; Gonzalez-Garcia, Alberto/0000-0002-1969-3818; Jimenez Aceituno, Amanda/0000-0002-5950-4751","Mountain Research Initiative Synthesis Workshops - TRANSMOUNT project; French National Research Agency's Programme d'Investissements d'Avenir - Make Our Planet Great Again [ANR-19-MPGA-0009]; MtnPaths - Pathways for global change adaptation of mountain socio-ecological systems, Swiss National Science Foundation [20521L_169916]","Mountain Research Initiative Synthesis Workshops - TRANSMOUNT project; French National Research Agency's Programme d'Investissements d'Avenir - Make Our Planet Great Again(French National Research Agency (ANR)); MtnPaths - Pathways for global change adaptation of mountain socio-ecological systems, Swiss National Science Foundation","We thank the PANORAMA initiative and the solution providers for the data provided, as well as three anonymous reviewers for insightful comments on a previous version of this article.

We combine satellite-based observations with an enhanced dynamic global vegetation model to make regionally resolved global assessments of burned area (BA) responses to changing climate, derived from 34 Earth system models and human demographics for 1860-2100. Limited by climate and socioeconomics, recent BA has decreased, especially in central South America and mesic African savannas. However, future simulations predict increasing BA due to changing climate, rapid population density growth, and urbanization. BA increases are especially notable at high latitudes, due to accelerated warming, and over the tropics and subtropics, due to drying and human ignitions. Conversely, rapid urbanization also limits BA via enhanced fire suppression in the immediate vicinity of settlements, offsetting the potential for dramatic future increases, depending on warming extent. Our analysis provides further insight into regional and global BA trends, highlighting the importance of including human demographic change in models for wildfire under changing climate.","[Wu, Chao; Venevsky, Sergey] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Minist Educ, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Wu, Chao; Sitch, Stephen; Mercado, Lina M.] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, England; [Mercado, Lina M.; Huntingford, Chris] UK Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England; [Wu, Chao; Staver, A.

Yet, large-scale trends in tree mortality and their effects on forest demography remain poorly quantified despite the important role of forest demography for forest carbon pools and biodiversity. Analyzing satellite data at 19,896 plots, we here show that canopy mortality in 35 European countries increased from 1985 to 2018 (+1.5% +/- 0.28% yr(-1)). Using simulations, we demonstrate that recent levels of canopy mortality will halt the aging trend of Europe's forests and that a further increase in canopy mortality has the potential to strongly alter Europe's forest demography toward younger forests. These demographic changes will have cascading negative effects on forest biodiversity and carbon storage. Developing strategies to address the increasing canopy mortality should thus be a key priority of forest policy and management in Europe.","[Senf, Cornelius; Sebald, Julius; Seidl, Rupert] Tech Univ Munich, Ecosyst Dynam & Forest Management Grp, Hans Carl Von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Senf, Cornelius; Sebald, Julius; Seidl, Rupert] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci BOKU Vienna, Inst Silviculture, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Seidl, Rupert] Berchtesgaden Natl Pk, Doktorberg 6, D-83471 Berchtesgaden, Germany","Technical University of Munich; University of Natural Resources & Life Sciences, Vienna","Senf, C (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Ecosyst Dynam & Forest Management Grp, Hans Carl Von Carlowitz Pl 2, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.;Senf, C (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci BOKU Vienna, Inst Silviculture, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.",cornelius.senf@tum.de,,"Senf, Cornelius/0000-0002-2389-2158",Austrian Science Fund (FWF) Lise-Meitner Program [M2652]; FWF START grant [Y895-B25],Austrian Science Fund (FWF) Lise-Meitner Program(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); FWF START grant,"We thank Alice Cosatti, Barbara Ollerer, Benjamin Stadler, Laura Steinbach, and Lukas Weikl for their help with the interpretation of the satellite data.

Trees are utilized to adapt to urban heat; however, most tree planting is prioritized by either biophysical or social metrics, rather than an integration of the two. It therefore remains unclear how to maximize ecological and social benefits of tree planting in the context of environmental justice. Here, we analyze social vulnerability to heat and the cooling capacity of trees across 38 of the largest cities in the United States. We find that socially vulnerable people tend to live in hotter neighborhoods with less tree canopy. Furthermore, tree planting in such neighborhoods can achieve greater cooling benefits per unit increase in canopy. Increasing tree cover in these neighborhoods will meet the greatest need for cooling and achieve greater cooling capacity, creating social and ecological co-benefits. Adaptation measures must address both the distributional injustices of urban heat and procedural justice in planning and managing nature-based cooling approaches.","[Zhou, Weiqi; Wang, Jing; Wang, Jia] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, 18 Shuangqing Rd, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Weiqi; Wang, Jia] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, 19A Yuquan Rd, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Weiqi; Wang, Jing] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, Beijing JingJinJi Urban Megareg Natl Observat & R, 18 Shuangqing Rd, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Huang, Ganlin] Beijing Normal Univ, Ctr Land Resources & Reg Dev CLRRD, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, 19 Xinjiekouwai St, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Huang, Ganlin] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, Sch Nat Resources, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Pickett, Steward T.

Although it is widely accepted that climate change perturbs these conditions, no systematic understanding exists on where and how the major risks for entering unprecedented conditions may occur. Here, we address this gap by introducing the concept of safe climatic space (SCS), which incorporates the decisive climatic factors of agricultural production: precipitation, temperature, and aridity. We show that a rapid and unhalted growth of greenhouse gas emissions (SSP5-8.5) could force 31% of the global food crop and 34% of livestock production beyond the SCS by 2081-2100. The most vulnerable areas are South and Southeast Asia and Africa's Sudano-Sahelian Zone, which have low resilience to cope with these changes. Our results underpin the importance of committing to a low-emissions scenario (SSP1-2.6), whereupon the extent of food production facing unprecedented conditions would be a fraction.","[Kummu, Matti; Heino, Matias; Taka, Maija; Varis, Olli] Aalto Univ, Water & Dev Res Grp, Espoo, Finland; [Viviroli, Daniel] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Zurich, Switzerland",Aalto University; University of Zurich,"Kummu, M (corresponding author), Aalto Univ, Water & Dev Res Grp, Espoo, Finland.",matti.kummu@aalto.fi,"Viviroli, Daniel/A-6720-2008; Taka, Maija/AAY-1454-2020; Kummu, Matti/C-4797-2011","Viviroli, Daniel/0000-0002-1214-8657; Taka, Maija/0000-0002-6147-9137; Kummu, Matti/0000-0001-5096-0163; Varis, Olli/0000-0001-9231-4549; Heino, Matias/0000-0003-4294-7756","Academy of Finland [305471, 317320, 339834]; Academy of Finland SRC project Winland''; Emil Aaltonen Foundation project eat-less-water''; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme [819202]; Maa-ja Vesitekniikan Tuki Ry; Aalto University Engineering doctoral program; Academy of Finland (AKA) [317320] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA)",Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Academy of Finland SRC project Winland''; Emil Aaltonen Foundation project eat-less-water''; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme(European Research Council (ERC)); Maa-ja Vesitekniikan Tuki Ry; Aalto University Engineering doctoral program; Academy of Finland (AKA)(Academy of Finland),"M.K. received financial support from the Academy of Finland projects WASCO (grant 305471), WATVUL (grant 317320), and TREFORM (grant 339834); the Academy of Finland SRC project Winland''; the Emil Aaltonen Foundation project eat-less-water''; and the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme (grant agreement 819202).

However, the extent to which these measures have been effective is obscured by the existence of confounding meteorological effects. Here, we use a newly developed reduced-form model that can address emission-driven PM2.5 trends and control for meteorological effects to examine the level of PM2.5 reduction across 367 cities since the introduction of the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan (the Plan) in 2013. Our findings show that, on average, the national annual mean level of PM2.5 decreased by 34% from 2013 to 2019 after the removal of meteorological effects, about 10% less than the reduction level officially observed.

Support for this transition is often dampened by the impact on fossil fuel jobs. Previous work shows that pro-climate polices could increase employment by 20 million net energy jobs, but these studies rely on Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) jobs data, assumptions about jobs in non OECD countries, and a single baseline assumption. Here we combine a global dataset of job intensities across 11 energy technologies and five job categories in 50 countries with an integrated assessment model under three shared socioeconomic pathways. We estimate direct energy jobs under a WB2C scenario and current policy scenarios. We find that, by 2050, energy sector jobs would grow from today's 18 million to 26 million under a WB2C scenario compared with 21 million under the current policy scenario.

How forest vulnerability varies across space and time and what level of stress forests can tolerate before facing a tipping point are poorly understood. Here, we develop a tropical forest vulnerability index (TFVI) to detect and evaluate the vulnerability of global tropical forests to threats across space and time. We show that climate change together with land-use change have slowed the recovery rate of forest carbon cycling. Temporal autocorrelation, as an indicator of this slow recovery, increases substantially for above-ground biomass, gross primary production, and evapotranspiration when climate stress reaches a critical level. Forests in the Americas exhibit extensive vulnerability to these stressors, while in Africa, forests show relative resilience to climate, and in Asia reveal more vulnerability to land use and fragmentation. TFVI can systematically track the response of tropical forests to multiple stressors and provide early-warning signals for regions undergoing critical transitions.","[Saatchi, Sassan; Longo, Marcos; Xu, Liang; Yang, Yan] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Saatchi, Sassan] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Abe, Hitofumi] United Nations, Food & Agr Org, Port Moresby, Papua N Guinea; [Andre, Michel] Tech Univ Catalonia, Lab Appl Bioacoust, Barcelona, Spain; [Aukema, Juliann E.; Gibbon, Lucy; Johnson, Christine May] US Agcy Int Dev, Washington, DC 20523 USA; [Carvalhais, Nuno] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Jena, Germany; [Carvalhais, Nuno] Univ Nova Lisboa, Dept Ciencias & Engn Ambiente, Caparica, Portugal; [Cadillo-Quiroz, Hinsby] Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ USA; [Cerbu, Gillian Ann; Lumbuenamo, Raymond] World Bank Grp, Washington, DC USA; [Chernela, Janet M.] Univ Maryland, Dept Anthropol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Covey, Kristofer] Skidmore Coll, Environm Studies & Sci Program, Saratoga Springs, NY 12866 USA; [Sanchez-Clavijo, Lina Maria] Inst Invest Recursos Biol Alexander von Humboldt, Bogota, Colombia; [Cubillos, Isai V.] Nature Conservancy, Bogota, Colombia; [Davies, Stuart J.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Forest Global Earth Observ, Washington, DC USA; [De Sy, Veronique] Wageningen Univ, Lab Geoinformat Sci & Remote Sensing, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [De Vleeschouwer, Francois] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CNRS, Inst Franco Argentino Estudio Clima & Sus Impacto, UMI 3351,IFAECI,UBA,IRD, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Duque, Alvaro] Univ Nacl Colombia, Dept Ciencias Forestales, Medellin, Colombia; [Durieux, Alice Marie Sybille] Descartes Labs, Santa Fe, NM USA; [Fernandes, Katia De Avila] Univ Arkansas, Dept Geosci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Fernandez, Luis E.] Wake Forest Univ, Dept Biol, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA; [Gammino, Victoria] Drexel Univ, Dornsife Sch Publ Hlth, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Garrity, Dennis P.; Gibbs, David A.; Harris, Nancy Lee; Stolle, Fred] World Resources Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Gowae, Gae Yansom] Univ Papua New Guinea, Dept Environm Sci & Geog, Port Moresby, Papua N Guinea; [Hansen, Matthew] Univ Maryland, Dept Geol Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Healey, Sean P.] US Forest Serv, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Ogden, UT USA; [Hilton, Robert G.] Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham, England; [Kankeu, Richard Sufo] Univ Maine, ESO Lab, Dept Geog, Le Mans, France; [Laporte-Goetz, Nadine Therese] No Arizona Univ, Sch Forestry, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Lee, Hyongki] Univ Houston, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Lovejoy, Thomas] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Lowman, Margaret] TREE Fdn, Sarasota, FL USA; [Malhi, Yadvinder] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford OX1 3QT, England; [Martinez, Jean-Michel M.

Yet individual decisions to migrate involve multiple motivations including perceived environmental risks and economic opportunities. We analyze how perceptions of environmental risks affect migration decisions and future migration intentions. We use cross-sectional household survey data (N = 5,450) from populations engaged in migration in net out-migration areas in four coastal areas in Ghana, Bangladesh, and India to examine ex post-migration motivations and ex ante-future migration intentions. The data include variables on previous migration, migration intentions, well-being, food insecurity, and perceived long-term environmental degradation. The results show that few households identified environmental risks as the primary driver for past migration decisions. Perceived increased severity of drought and household insecurity both reduce stated future migration intentions. Hence, perceptions of environmental risks, including future potential changes, are significant in altering aggregate migration flows from source areas in low-lying coastal regions.","[Adger, William Neil; de Campos, Ricardo Safra; Gavonel, Maria Franco; Mortreux, Colette] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England; [de Campos, Ricardo Safra] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Global Syst Inst, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England; [Codjoe, Samuel Nii Ardey; Abu, Mumuni] Univ Ghana, Coll Humanities, Reg Inst Populat Studies, POB LG96, Legon, Accra, Ghana; [Siddiqui, Tasneem] Univ Dhaka, Refugee & Migratory Movements Res Unit, Nilkhet Rd, Dhaka 1000, Bangladesh; [Hazra, Sugata; Das, Shouvik] Jadavpur Univ, Sch Oceanog Studies, Kolkata 700032, India; [Adams, Helen] Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, Bush House,30 Aldwych, London WC2B 4BG, England",RLUK- Research Libraries UK; University of Exeter; RLUK- Research Libraries UK; University of Exeter; University of Ghana; University of Dhaka; Jadavpur University; RLUK- Research Libraries UK; University of London; King's College London,"Adger, WN (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England.",n.adger@exeter.ac.uk,"Abu, Mumuni/Y-2583-2019; Adger, William Neil/F-7676-2010","Abu, Mumuni/0000-0002-6455-0162; Siddiqui, Tasneem/0000-0003-4733-7439; Franco Gavonel, Maria/0000-0003-2377-5987; Mortreux, Colette/0000-0001-6855-4139; Safra de Campos, Ricardo/0000-0003-2345-7524; Codjoe, Samuel Nii Ardey/0000-0002-6567-0262; Adger, William Neil/0000-0003-4244-2854","Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia through the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office; International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada; Belmont Forum; UK Research and Innovation [ES/S007687/1]; International Development Research Centre, Ottawa [109223-002]; ESRC [ES/S007687/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia through the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office; International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada(CGIAR); Belmont Forum; UK Research and Innovation(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)); International Development Research Centre, Ottawa; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","Funding is acknowledged from the Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia through the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and the International Development Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada.

Alternative energy vehicles (AEVs) (electric, hydrogen fuel cell, and natural gas vehicles) can reduce carbon emissions and improve air quality. However, climate, air quality, and health benefits of AEVs powered with deeply decarbonized power generation are poorly quantified. Here, we quantitatively estimate the air quality, health, carbon emission, and economic benefits of replacing internal combustion engine vehicles with various AEVs. We find co-benefits increase dramatically as the electricity grid decarbonizes and hydrogen is produced from non-fossil fuels. Relative to 2015, a conversion to AEVs using largely non-fossil power can reduce air pollution and associated premature mortalities and years of life lost by similar to 329,000 persons/year and similar to 1,611,000 life years/year. Thus, maximizing climate, air quality, and health benefits of AEV deployment in China requires rapid decarbonization of the power system.","[Peng, Liqun; Liu, Feiqi; Zhou, Mi; Li, Mingwei; Mauzerall, Denise L.] Princeton Univ, Princeton Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Liu, Feiqi] Tsinghua Univ, State Key Lab Automot Safety & Energy, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Mi] Peking Univ, Lab Climate & Ocean Atmosphere Studies, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Sch Phys, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qiang] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Minist Educ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Mauzerall, Denise L.] Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University; Tsinghua University; Peking University; Tsinghua University; Princeton University,"Mauzerall, DL (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Princeton Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.;Mauzerall, DL (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",mauzerall@princeton.edu,"Li, Mingwei/Z-5407-2019; Mauzerall, Denise L/I-5977-2013; zhang, qiang/HZJ-9551-2023; Zhang, Qiang/D-9034-2012","Li, Mingwei/0000-0002-1896-3484; Mauzerall, Denise L/0000-0003-3479-1798; Zhou, Mi/0000-0001-8600-1503",Princeton School of Public and International Affairs; Ma Huateng Foundation; High Meadows Foundation; China Scholarship Council,Princeton School of Public and International Affairs; Ma Huateng Foundation; High Meadows Foundation; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"This work was funded by the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs, the Ma Huateng Foundation, the High Meadows Foundation, and the China Scholarship Council.

However, widely used models cannot reproduce primary and secondary OA concentrations, and thus the source contributions of OA remain elusive. This is largely caused by the oversimplification of traditional organic emission inventories. Here, we develop an emission framework that achieves a full volatility coverage in both the gas and particle phases with a high chemical and volatility resolution. The new inventory fills a gap of 3,382 kt/y semi-and intermediate-volatility organic emissions and 59% ambient secondary OA (SOA) concentrations in China 2017, resulting in a significantly improved model-measurement agreement. Volatile chemical products, domestic combustion, and biomass open burning, with their SOA contributions increased by a factor of two to nine, turn out to be three leading sources of SOA. Future control policies must focus more on these previously underestimated sources.","[Chang, Xing; Zhao, Bin; Zheng, Haotian; Wang, Shuxia; Cai, Siyi; Huang, Guanghan; Wu, Di; Han, Licong; Xing, Jia; Hu, Ruolan; Liang, Chengrui; Xu, Qingcheng; Ding, Dian; Liu, Kaiyun; Han, Rui] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Chang, Xing; Zhao, Bin; Zheng, Haotian; Wang, Shuxia; Cai, Siyi; Huang, Guanghan; Wu, Di; Han, Licong; Xing, Jia; Hu, Ruolan; Liang, Chengrui; Xu, Qingcheng; Ding, Dian; Liu, Kaiyun] State Environm Protect Key Lab Sources & Control, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Guo, Fengqiao; Gui, Ping] China Acad Urban Planning & Design, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Man, Hanyang] Fujian Normal Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Fuzhou 350007, Peoples R China; [Qiu, Xionghui] North China Elect Power Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Han, Rui] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Meteorol Informat Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Robinson, Allen L.; Donahue, Neil M.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Ctr Atmospher Particle Studies, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Donahue, Neil M.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Donahue, Neil M.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Chem, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Donahue, Neil M.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Engn & Publ Policy, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Tsinghua University; Fujian Normal University; North China Electric Power University; China Meteorological Administration; Carnegie Mellon University; Carnegie Mellon University; Carnegie Mellon University; Carnegie Mellon University,"Wang, SX (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.;Wang, SX (corresponding author), State Environm Protect Key Lab Sources & Control, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",shxwang@tsinghua.edu.cn,"wang, shuxiao/H-5990-2011; Donahue, Neil M/A-2329-2008; Zhao, Bin/AAQ-9989-2021; Studies, Center for Atmospheric Particle/AAR-6731-2020; Robinson, Allen L/M-3046-2014; Zheng, Haotian/AAE-5404-2019","wang, shuxiao/0000-0001-9727-1963; Donahue, Neil M/0000-0003-3054-2364; Zhao, Bin/0000-0001-8438-9188; Robinson, Allen L/0000-0002-1819-083X; Huang, Guanghan/0000-0002-0693-300X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [21625701, 92044302, 22188102]; Samsung Advanced Institute of Tech-nology; Tencent Foundation",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Samsung Advanced Institute of Tech-nology(Samsung); Tencent Foundation,"This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (21625701, 92044302, and 22188102) , Samsung Advanced Institute of Tech-nology, and Tencent Foundation through the XPLORER PRIZE.

Here, we consider high-stakes investments across the water, energy, and food sectors for two major river basins in a climate transition zone in Africa. We integrate detailed interpretation of observed and modeled climate-system behavior with hydrological modeling and decision-relevant performance metrics. For the Rufiji River in Tanzania, projected risks for the mid-21st century are similar to those of the present day, but for the Lake Malawi-Shire River, future risk exceeds that experienced during the 20th century. In both basins a repeat of an early-20th century multi-year drought would challenge the viability of proposed infrastructure. A long view, which emphasizes past and future changes in variability, set within a broader context of climate-information interpretation and decision making, is crucial for screening the risk to infrastructure.","[Siderius, Christian; Pardoe, Joanna; Conway, Declan] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England; [Siderius, Christian] Uncharted Waters Res, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Kolusu, Seshagiri R.] UK Met Off, Exeter, Devon, England; [Kolusu, Seshagiri R.; Todd, Martin C.] Univ Sussex, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Bhave, Ajay] Newcastle Univ, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Dougill, Andy J.] Univ Leeds, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Reason, Chris J.

Yet the nutritional value of reef fisheries and climate impacts on micronutrient availability remain unclear, hindering efforts to sustain food and nutrition security. Here, we measure nutrient content in coral reef fishes in Seychelles and show that reef fish are important sources of selenium and zinc and contain levels of calcium, iron, and omega-3 fatty acids comparable with other animal-source foods. Using experimental fishing, we demonstrate that iron and zinc are enriched in fishes caught on regime-shifted macroalgal habitats, whereas selenium and omega-3 varied among species. We find substantial increases in nutrients available to fisheries over two decades following coral bleaching, particularly for iron and zinc after macroalgal regime shifts. Our findings indicate that, if managed sustainably, coral reef fisheries could remain important micronutrient sources along tropical coastlines despite escalating climate impacts.","[Robinson, James P.

The remaining scenarios as well as many scenarios for coal and gas decline in other regions have precedents only where oil was replaced by coal, gas, or nuclear power in response to energy security threats.

The scenarios take place between the years 2030 and 2060 in the North-East Atlantic (scramble for the Atlantic''), the East China Sea (the remodeled empire''), the coast of West Africa (oceanic decolonization''), and the Arctic (polar renaissance'').

Here, we link billions of repeated sleep measurements from sleep-tracking wristbands comprising over 7 million sleep records (n = 47,628) across 68 countries to local daily meteorological data. Controlling for individual, seasonal, and time varying confounds, increased temperature shortens sleep primarily through delayed onset, increasing the probability of insufficient sleep. The temperature effect on sleep loss is substantially larger for residents from lower-income countries and older adults, and females are affected more than males. Those in hotter regions experience comparably more sleep loss per degree of warming, suggesting limited adaptation.

How can this gap be closed? Recent work has theorized that the perceived urgency of climate change drives public support for climate policy, but this lacks empirical evidence. Using advanced sparse regressions and comparative survey-embedded framing experiments with 9,911 eligible voters in Germany and the United States, we empirically studied the role of perceived urgency. Our study provides two findings. First, although perceived urgency is key in driving support for low-cost'' mitigation policies, it does not lead to more support for high-cost'' mitigation policies where the behavioral implications are visible. Second, while temporal reframing does not increase policy support or feelings of dread, context information about demand-side mitigation increases support for such costly climate policies. The results are particularly relevant for democracies, where ambitious policies require the support of citizens.","[Fesenfeld, Lukas Paul] Univ Bern, Inst Polit Sci, Bern, Switzerland; [Fesenfeld, Lukas Paul] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Humanities Social & Polit Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Rinscheid, Adrian] Univ St Gallen, Inst Econ & Environm, St Gallen, Switzerland",University of Bern; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of St Gallen,"Fesenfeld, LP (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Polit Sci, Bern, Switzerland.;Fesenfeld, LP (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Humanities Social & Polit Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.",lukas.fesenfeld@gess.ethz.ch,"Rinscheid, Adrian/ABA-6487-2020","Rinscheid, Adrian/0000-0003-3160-538X; Fesenfeld, Lukas Paul/0000-0002-4504-036X","EU ERC [295456]; Heinrich Boell Foundation; Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment at Princeton University; Swiss Competence Center for Research in Energy, Society, and Transition SCCER CREST","EU ERC(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission); Heinrich Boell Foundation; Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment at Princeton University; Swiss Competence Center for Research in Energy, Society, and Transition SCCER CREST","L.P.F. acknowledges financial support from the EU ERC (295456) and the Heinrich Boell Foundation.

A variety of different technologies could contribute to this transition, and uncertainty remains over their relative role and value. A growing school of thought argues that rapid cost reductions in renewables reduce the need for carbon capture and storage (CCS) in mitigation pathways. Here we use an integrated assessment model to explore how the value of CCS is affected by cost reductions in solar photovoltaics, onshore, and offshore wind. Low-cost renewables could erode the value of CCS by 15%-96% across different energy sectors. Renewables directly compete with CCS, accelerate power sector decarbonization, and enable greater electrification of end-use sectors. CCS has greatest value and resilience to low-cost renewables in sustainable bioenergy/industrial applications, with limited value in hydrogen/electricity generation. This suggests that targeted, rather than blanket, CCS deployment represents the best strategy for achieving the Paris Agreement goals.","[Grant, Neil; Napp, Tamaryn; Gambhir, Ajay] Imperial Coll London, Grantham Inst Climate Change & Environm, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Hawkes, Adam] Imperial Coll London, Dept Chem Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England",Imperial College London; Imperial College London,"Grant, N (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Grantham Inst Climate Change & Environm, London SW7 2AZ, England.",n.grant18@imperial.ac.uk,"Hawkes, Adam/F-6631-2012","Hawkes, Adam/0000-0001-9720-332X; Grant, Neil/0000-0001-8671-5012; Gambhir, Ajay/0000-0002-5079-4537",Science and Solutions for a Changing Planet Doctoral Training Programme (SSCP DTP) by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Grantham Institute; H2020 European Commission Project PARIS REINFORCE [820846],Science and Solutions for a Changing Planet Doctoral Training Programme (SSCP DTP) by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Grantham Institute; H2020 European Commission Project PARIS REINFORCE,"N.G. would like to thank the Science and Solutions for a Changing Planet Doctoral Training Programme (SSCP DTP) by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and the Grantham Institute for supporting their PhD research.

A perceived economic growth-climate mitigation trade-off has diminished political will to act. However, there is no scholarly consensus regarding the magnitude of the trade-off between economic growth and CO2 mitigation and a lack of ex post evidence regarding the extent to which mitigation measures can effectively lower CO2 emissions. Here, we present a structural equation model integrating emissions and economic and energy system characteristics over the period 1970-2016 to empirically assess mechanisms that influence the GDP-CO2 relationship for 73 countries. Robust to various model specifications and statistical tests, we found a simple unitary scale effect between per capita GDP and per capita CO2 emissions, while five emission-reduction mechanisms, principally energy system decarbonization and productivity gains, collectively contributed to global emission reductions by 19 petagrams. Within the observed yearto-year emissions development, reductions at a rate consistent with the Paris Agreement can be achieved in about 10% of instances while maintaining economic growth.","[Wang, Ranran] Leiden Univ, Inst Environm Sci CML, Fac Sci, NL-2333 Leiden, Netherlands; [Wang, Ranran] Univ Twente, Fac Engn Technol, Drienerlolaan 5, NL-7522 Enschede, Netherlands; [Wang, Ranran; Hertwich, Edgar G.] Yale Sch Environm, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Assenova, Valentina A.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Management Dept, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Hertwich, Edgar G.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Energy & Proc Engn, Kolbjorn Hejes V 1B, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; University of Pennsylvania; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Hertwich, EG (corresponding author), Yale Sch Environm, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.;Hertwich, EG (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Energy & Proc Engn, Kolbjorn Hejes V 1B, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",edgar.hertwich@ntnu.no,,"Hertwich, Edgar/0000-0002-4934-3421; Wang, Ranran/0000-0001-7786-3179; /0000-0002-5637-8139",Yale University; Research Council of Norway (FME NTRANS-Grant) [296205],Yale University; Research Council of Norway (FME NTRANS-Grant)(Research Council of Norway),The authors acknowledge early input by Matthew Kotchen and David I.

A major uncertainty is how increased burning will interact with climate change to exacerbate thermokarst (ground-surface collapse resulting from permafrost thaw). Here we show that thermokarst rates increased by similar to 60% with warming climate and wildfire from 1950 to 2015 in Arctic Alaska. Wildfire amplified thermokarst over 40+ years, cumulatively creating similar to 9 times thermokarst formation as that in unburned tundra. However, thermokarst triggered by repeat bums did not differ from that triggered by single burns, irrespective of time between fires. Our simulation identified climate change as the principal driver of all thermokarst formed during 1950-2015 (4,700 km(2)) in Arctic Alaska, but wildfire was disproportionately responsible for 10.5% of the thermokarst by burning merely 3.4% of the landscape. These results combined suggest that climate change and wildfire will synergistically accelerate thermokarst as the Arctic transitions in this century.","[Chen, Yaping; Lara, Mark J.; Hu, Feng Sheng] Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Chen, Yaping] Coll William & Mary, Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA; [Lara, Mark J.] Univ Illinois, Dept Geog, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Jones, Benjamin M.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Water & Environm Res Ctr, Inst Northern Engn, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Frost, Gerald, V] Alaska Biol Res Inc, POB 80410, Fairbanks, AK 99708 USA; [Hu, Feng Sheng] Univ Illinois, Dept Geol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Hu, Feng Sheng] Washington Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Hu, Feng Sheng] Washington Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, St Louis, MO 63130 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; William & Mary; Virginia Institute of Marine Science; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Washington University (WUSTL); Washington University (WUSTL),"Chen, YP; Lara, MJ; Hu, FS (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.;Chen, YP (corresponding author), Coll William & Mary, Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA.;Lara, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Geog, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.;Hu, FS (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Geol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.;Hu, FS (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Dept Biol, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.;Hu, FS (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",ychen@vims.edu; mjlara@illinois.edu; fshu@wustl.edu,"Lara, Mark J./I-6049-2019; Hu, Feng/IAN-4009-2023","Lara, Mark J./0000-0002-4670-7031; Frost, Gerald/0000-0002-5134-0334; Chen, Yaping/0000-0003-1372-8861","NSF [1023477, 1636476, 1928048]; Polar Geospatial Center under NSF PLR awards [1043681, 1559691]; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [1636476] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Of Chem, Bioeng, Env, & Transp Sys; Directorate For Engineering [1928048] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Polar Geospatial Center under NSF PLR awards; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); Div Of Chem, Bioeng, Env, & Transp Sys; Directorate For Engineering(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG))","Funding for this research was provided by the NSF (1023477 and 1636476 to F.S.H and 1928048 to M.J.L) .

The government has implemented measures to replace coal with relatively clean energy sources (e.g., natural gas). However, the scale and scope of health benefits associated with such energy switching in an urban context, when considering both ambient and indoor air quality, remain unclear. Here we used an atmospheric chemical transport model showing that relatively clean energy use increased from 2% to 71% from 1980 to 2014, and although annual premature deaths attributed to particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 mm (PM2.5) from urban residential sources increased from 136,000 (87,000-194,000) to 202,000 (117,000-302,000) during the same period, this was primarily due to population growth, urbanization, aging, and backgroundmortality rate changes. In the absence of energy switching, there would have been 2.2 million additional premature deaths. The results provide solid evidence on health benefits of energy switching, suggesting further switching to cleaner energy for expanded health-climate co-benefits.","[Zhang, Wenxiao; Yun, Xiao; Meng, Wenjun; Xu, Haoran; Zhong, Qirui; Yu, Xinyuan; Ren, Yu'ang; Shen, Guofeng; Ma, Jianmin; Cheng, Hefa; Li, Bengang; Liu, Junfeng; Wang, Xuejun; Tao, Shu] Peking Univ, Sino French Inst Earth Syst Sci, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Lab Earth Surface Proc, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Shen, Huizhong; Chen, Yilin; Tao, Shu] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China",Peking University; Southern University of Science & Technology,"Tao, S (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Sino French Inst Earth Syst Sci, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Lab Earth Surface Proc, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.;Tao, S (corresponding author), Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.",taos@pku.edu.cn,"Zhong, Qirui/AAD-7460-2022; xu, haodong/IAM-9132-2023; SHEN, Guofeng/F-3163-2015; Shen, Huizhong/E-8152-2017; Cheng, Hefa/A-1193-2007; xu, hao/GWQ-7394-2022; Chen, Yilin/HLW-9992-2023","Zhong, Qirui/0000-0002-1397-6024; SHEN, Guofeng/0000-0002-7731-5399; Shen, Huizhong/0000-0003-1335-8477; Cheng, Hefa/0000-0003-4911-6971; Chen, Yilin/0000-0001-5532-4115; Yun, Xiao/0000-0002-1062-1244; Zhang, Wenxiao/0000-0002-0234-9295","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41991312, 41830641, 41922057, 41821005]; Chinese Academy of Science [2019QZKK0605, XDA23010100]; Undergraduate Student Research Training Program; High-performance Computing Platform of Peking University",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chinese Academy of Science(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Undergraduate Student Research Training Program; High-performance Computing Platform of Peking University,"This work is funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grants 41991312, 41830641, 41922057, and 41821005) , Chinese Academy of Science (2019QZKK0605, XDA23010100) , and Undergraduate Student Research Training Program, and supported by the High-performance Computing Platform of Peking University.",,100,8,9,20,100,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2590-3330,2590-3322,,ONE EARTH,One Earth,NOV 19,2021,4,11,,,,,1602,1613,,10.1016/j.oneear.2021.10.013,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.oneear.2021.10.013,,NOV 2021,13,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,XO5MF,,Bronze,,,2023-06-02,WOS:000730228700017,View Full Record in Web of Science

The impacts of climate change on average wheat yields are reasonably well studied, but its effects on yield variability and the associated economic consequences are poorly understood. Here, we show that future global wheat pri-ces will exhibit steeper spikes at 2 & DEG;C global warming (6.2% increase in the 95th percentile of global consumer price anomalies) despite a 1.7% increase in production given that CO2 fertilization benefits crops. Such eco-nomic stresses could be abated by trade liberalization with lower prices. However, on the supply side, trade liberalization has contrasting effects: the profitability of farmers in advanced economies can be maintained or even raised, but this will inevitably cause economic losses and inequalities for farmers in less-developed, wheat-importing countries. Agricultural trade liberalization accompanied by protection policies in developing countries would be beneficial for global food security in the threat of climate change.","[Zhang, Tianyi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Atmospher Boundary Layer Phys & Atmo, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Tianyi] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteorol, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Wiel, Karin van der; Bintanja, Richard] Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst, De Bilt, Netherlands; [Wei, Taoyuan; Glomsrod, Solveig] Ctr Int Climate & Environm Res, Oslo, Norway; [Screen, James; Blackport, Russell] Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Exeter, Devon, England; [Yue, Xu] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Bangyou] Queensland Biosci Precinct, CSIRO Plant Ind, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Selten, Frank] Univ Groningen, Energy & Sustainabil Res Inst Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; [Bintanja, Richard] Society, Int Res Inst Climate, Palisades, NY USA; [Liu, Yu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Sci & Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yu] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Cui, Xuefeng] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Syst Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yang, Xiaoguang] China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute; University of Exeter; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Groningen; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Beijing Normal University; China Agricultural University","Zhang, TY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Atmospher Boundary Layer Phys & Atmo, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Zhang, TY (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteorol, Nanjing, Peoples R China.;Wiel, KV (corresponding author), Royal Netherlands Meteorol Inst, De Bilt, Netherlands.;Yang, XG (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhangty@mail.iap.ac.cn; karin.van.der.wiel@knmi.nl; yangxg@cau.edu.cn,"Zheng, Bangyou/D-6832-2011; Screen, James A/D-7588-2013; Yue, Xu/ABD-9066-2021","Bintanja, Richard/0000-0002-0465-5923",National Key Research and Development Project of China [2019YFA0607402]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41661144006]; Netherlands Organi- zation of Scientific Research [ALWCL.2016.2]; European Union [820712]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences [2018104]; 2115 Talent Development Program of China Agricultural University,National Key Research and Development Project of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Netherlands Organi- zation of Scientific Research(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); European Union(European Commission); Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences; 2115 Talent Development Program of China Agricultural University,"We appreciate the anonymous reviewers, editor, and M.S.

However, women leaders have been underrepresented in interdisciplinary marine research, and there is little guidance on how to achieve the conditions that will lead to an increased proportion of women scientists in positions of leadership. Here, we conduct in-depth qualitative research to explore the main barriers and enablers to women's leadership in an academic interdisciplinary marine research context. We found that interdisciplinarity can present unique and additional barriers to women leaders (e.g., complexity and lack of value attributed to interdisciplinary research) and are exacerbated by existing gender-specific issues that women experience (e.g., isolation and underrepresentation and stereotyping). Together these barriers overlap forming the glass obstacle course''-which is particularly challenging for women in minoritized groups. Here, we provide a list of concrete, ambitious, and actionable enablers that can promote and support women's leadership in academic interdisciplinary marine research.","[Shellock, Rebecca J.; Cvitanovic, Christopher; McKinnon, Merryn C.; Tuohy, Paris] Australian Natl Univ, Australian Natl Ctr Publ Awareness Sci, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Mackay, Mary; Kelly, Rachel; van Putten, Ingrid E.; Hardesty, Britta Denise; Pecl, Gretta T.] Univ Tasmania, Ctr Marine Socioecol, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Mackay, Mary; Kelly, Rachel; van Putten, Ingrid E.; Hardesty, Britta Denise] CSIRO, CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Blythe, Jessica] Brock Univ, Environm Sustainabil Res Ctr, St Catharines, ON, Canada; [Kelly, Rachel] Mem Univ, Future Ocean & Coastal Infrastruct Consortium, St John, NL, Canada; [Bailey, Megan] Dalhousie Univ, Marine Affairs Program, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Begossi, Alpina] Univ Estadual Campinas, NEPA Nucleo Estudos & Pesquisas Alimentacao, Av Albert Einstein 291, BR-13083852 Campinas, SP, Brazil; [Begossi, Alpina] Fisheries & Food Inst FIFO, Rua Sousa Lima 16, BR-22081010 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Begossi, Alpina] Univ Santa Cecilia, Grad Grp, 12 R Cesario Mota 08, BR-11045040 Santos, SP, Brazil; [Crona, Beatrice] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden; [Crona, Beatrice] Royal Swedish Acad Sci, Beijer Inst Ecol Econ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Fakoya, Kafayat A.] Lagos State Univ, Lagos, Nigeria; [Ferreira, Beatrice P.] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Av Prof Moraes Rego S-N, BR-50670420 Recife, PE, Brazil; [Ferrer, Alice J.

The government has deployed Three Red Lines (TRLs) to improve water security by 2030 and committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2060. China's industries, which account for half of national CO2 emissions and >20% water withdrawals, is key to decarbonization and water conservation. However, there remains a lack of consensus regarding whether industrial emission reduction and water saving can be achieved simultaneously. Here, we adopt a general equilibrium model using a self-developed high-resolution provincial water-use inventory based on enterprise census data, to uncover the impacts achieving carbon neutrality would have on industrial water use across China. Meeting carbon neutrality enables the achievement of the TRL-associated industrial water-use target and can reduce industrial water use by 24% in 2060. Nevertheless, if inter-provincial industrial relocation occurs, water use could rise in certain provinces, reducing the above water-saving potential. Stricter and coordinated policies and technological advancements are essential to successfully address climate and water challenges concurrently.","[Liu, Xiaoyu; Dai, Hancheng; Ni, Jinren; Guo, Chaoyi; Liu, Xiaorui; Liu, Yong] Peking Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, State Environm Protect Key Lab All Mat Flux River, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Dai, Hancheng] Peking Univ, Inst Global Hlth & Dev, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Wada, Yoshihide; Kahil, Taher] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal IIASA, Water Program, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Chen, Bin] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yan] Chinese Acad Environm Planning, State Environm Protect Key Lab Environm Planning, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China; [Pan, Chen] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst Quantitat & Technol Econ, Beijing 100732, Peoples R China",Peking University; Peking University; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Beijing Normal University; Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Liu, Y (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, State Environm Protect Key Lab All Mat Flux River, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",yongliu@pku.edu.cn,"Liu, Yong/B-1826-2008","Liu, Yong/0000-0001-8181-1080; Kahil, Taher/0000-0002-7812-5271","National Natural Science Foundation of China [72073003, 51721006, 71810107001, 71704005, 51861135102, 71690241, 51811540348]; National Social Science Foundation of China [21AZD060]; Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China [B20009]; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA)","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Social Science Foundation of China; Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, China); International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA)","This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (72073003, 51721006, 71810107001, 71704005, 51861135102, and 71690241), National Social Science Foundation of China (21AZD060), and the 111 Project Urban Air Pollution and Health Effects (B20009) by the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China.

Climate warming and, in some regions, soil drying from enhanced evaporation are progressively threatening this large carbon stock. Here, we assess future CO2 and CH4 fluxes from northern peatlands using five land surface models that explicitly include representation of peatland processes. Under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 2.6, northern peatlands are projected to remain a net sink of CO2 and climate neutral for the next three centuries. A shift to a net CO2 source and a substantial increase in CH4 emissions are projected under RCP8.5, which could exacerbate global warming by 0.21 degrees C (range, 0.09-0.49 degrees C) by the year 2300. The true warming impact of peatlands might be higher owing to processes not simulated by the models and direct anthropogenic disturbance. Our study highlights the importance of understanding how future warming might trigger high carbon losses from northern peatlands.","[Qiu, Chunjing; Ciais, Philippe; Zhu, Dan; Guenet, Bertrand; Kwon, Min Jung; Salmon, Elodie] CEA CNRS UVSQ, UMR8212, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Qiu, Chunjing] Univ Paris Saclay, AgroParisTech, INRAE, UMR MIA 518, F-75231 Paris, France; [Zhu, Dan; Li, XinYu; Xi, Yi; Peng, Shushi] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Sino French Inst Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Guenet, Bertrand] PSL Res Univ, Lab Geol, CNRS, Ecole Normale Super,UMR 8538, Paris, France; [Chang, Jinfeng] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Environm & Resource Sci, Hangzhou 310058, Peoples R China; [Chaudhary, Nitin; Westermann, Sebastian] Univ Oslo, Dept Geosci, N-0371 Oslo, Norway; [Kleinen, Thomas; Brovkin, Victor] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Muller, Jurek; Joos, Fortunat] Univ Bern, Phys Inst, Climate & Environm Phys, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Muller, Jurek; Joos, Fortunat] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Chaudhary, Nitin; Zhang, Wenxin; Gustafson, Adrian; Miller, Paul A.; Smith, Benjamin; Warlind, David] Lund Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Ecosyst Sci, S-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Zhang, Wenxin; Schurgers, Guy] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Permafrost CENPERM, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Ballantyne, Ashley] Univ Montana, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Missoula, MT 59801 USA; [Brewer, Simon C.] Univ Utah, Dept Geog, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Charman, Dan J.; Gallego-Sala, Angela, V] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Geog Dept, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England; [Gasser, Thomas] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal IIASA, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Holden, Joseph] Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Lauerwald, Ronny] Univ Paris Saclay, UMR ECOSYS, AgroParisTech, INRAE, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France; [Page, Susan] Univ Leicester, Sch Geog Geol & Environm, Leicester, Leics, England; [Smith, Benjamin] Western Sydney Univ, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Richmond, NSW, Australia; [Stocker, Benjamin D.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Stocker, Benjamin D.] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Sannel, A.

Given the prominent role that VLMPAs play in ocean conservation, determining when and where novel conditions will emerge within VLMPAs is vital for ensuring a healthy ocean in the future. Here, using a non-parametric approach to detect novelty, we show that 60%-87% of the ocean and 76%-97% of VLMPAs are expected to contain novel conditions across multiple biogeochemical variables by 2100, with novel conditions in pH emerging by 2030. With most VLMPAs expected to contain environmental conditions unlike those currently within their boundaries, and given the likelihood of any of these climate futures unfolding, present-day management will need to consider alterations to current and future VLMPA design and use.","[Johnson, Steven Mana'oakamai] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Johnson, Steven Mana'oakamai] Arizona State Univ, Ctr Global Discovery & Conservat Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Johnson, Steven Mana'oakamai; Watson, James R.] Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Oregon State University,"Johnson, SM (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.;Johnson, SM (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Ctr Global Discovery & Conservat Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.;Johnson, SM (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",stevenjohnson@asu.edu,"Johnson, Steven Mana'oakamai/ABC-7915-2021","Johnson, Steven Mana'oakamai/0000-0001-6998-9759",,,,,74,7,7,4,15,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2590-3330,2590-3322,,ONE EARTH,One Earth,NOV 19,2021,4,11,,,,,1625,1634,,10.1016/j.oneear.2021.10.016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.oneear.2021.10.016,,NOV 2021,11,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,XO5MF,,,,,2023-06-02,WOS:000730228700019,View Full Record in Web of Science

We use a 3D model to examine how MeHg might respond to changes in primary production and plankton community driven by ocean acidification and alterations in physical factors (e.g., ocean temperature, circulation). Productivity changes lead to significant increases in seawater MeHg in the polar oceans and a decrease in the North Atlantic Ocean. Phytoplankton MeHg may increase at high latitudes and decrease in lower latitudes due to shifts in community structure. Ocean acidification might enhance phytoplankton MeHg uptake by promoting the growth of a small species that efficiently accumulate MeHg. Non-linearities in the food web structure lead to differing magnitudes of zooplankton MeHg changes relative to those for phytoplankton.

To combat these impacts, China introduced stricter air pollution standards for the cement industry in 2015, yet no plant-level analysis exists to determine their effectiveness. To analyze the impacts of emission regulations, we coupled 2014-2018 smokestack-level real-time observations with plant-specific information and constructed an hourly based dataset of air pollutants (particulate matter [PM], sulfur dioxide [SO2], nitrogen oxide [NOX]) and CO2 emissions. Our analysis shows that regulations introduced in 2015 led to PM, SO2, and NO(X )reductions of 50.3%, 43.6%, and 34.2%, respectively, but CO(2 )increased by 5%. Interestingly, 9.4% of the plants analyzed reached China's 2020 ultralow air pollution standards in 2018. Further analysis shows that if small and old plants are phased out and all remaining plants implement advanced equipment and improve fuels and energy efficiency, PM, SO2, NOX, and CO2 could be further reduced by 68.8%, 66.1%, 82.2%, and 62.0% by 2060.

Biomethane and biogas that use organic wastes as a feedstock have emerged as alternatives to natural gas, with lower carbon and methane emissions. However, the extent to which methane is still emitted at various stages along biogas and biomethane supply chains remains unclear. Here, we adopt a Monte Carlo approach to systematically synthesize the distribution of methane emissions at each key biomethane and biogas supply chain stage using data collected fromthe existing literature. We showthat the top 5% of emitters are responsible for 62% of emissions. Methane emissions could be more than two times of greater than previously estimated, with the digestate handling stage responsible for the majority of methane released. To ensure the climate benefits of biomethane and biogas production, effective methane-mitigation strategies must be designed and deployed at each supply chain stage.","[Bakkaloglu, Semra; Cooper, Jasmin; Hawkes, Adam] Imperial Coll London, Sustainable Gas Inst, London SW7 1NA, England; [Bakkaloglu, Semra; Cooper, Jasmin; Hawkes, Adam] Imperial Coll London, Dept Chem Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England",RLUK- Research Libraries UK; Imperial College London; RLUK- Research Libraries UK; Imperial College London,"Bakkaloglu, S (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Sustainable Gas Inst, London SW7 1NA, England.;Bakkaloglu, S (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Dept Chem Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England.",s.bakkaloglu@imperial.ac.uk,"Hawkes, Adam/F-6631-2012","Hawkes, Adam/0000-0001-9720-332X; Bakkaloglu, semra/0000-0002-0476-1929",Sustainable Gas Institute,Sustainable Gas Institute,"The authors would like to acknowledge the funding from the Sustainable Gas Institute, founded by Imperial College London.

Urban vegetation (UV), a mainstream nature-based solution (NBS), can mitigate urban challenges through providing important ecosystem services (ESs). However, successful implementation of UV to provide ESs, is impaired due to insufficient knowledge of its effectiveness under different climatic and socio-economic conditions. Here, we quantify seven ESs provided by UV across 2,148 cities with R250,000 residents. We show that UV makes substantial contributions to outdoor recreation and stormwater regulation but is less effective in reducing air pollution, in most cities, regardless of the climatic and socio-economic context.

Here, we estimate the global removal potential from nature restoration constrained by a responsible development framework and the contribution this would make to a 1.5 degrees C temperature limit. Our constrained restoration options result in a median of 103 GtC (5%-95% range of -91 to 196 GtC) in cumulative removals between 2020 and 2100. When combined with deep-decarbonization scenarios, our restoration scenario briefly exceeds 1.5 degrees C before declining to between 1.25 degrees C and 1.5 degrees C by 2100 (median, 50% probability). We conclude that additional carbon sequestration via nature restoration is unlikely to be done quickly enough to notably reduce the global peak temperatures expected in the next few decades. Land restoration is an important option for tackling climate change but cannot compensate for delays in reducing fossil fuel emissions.","[Dooley, Kate; Nicholls, Zebedee; Meinshausen, Malte] Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog Earth & Atmospher Sci, Parkville, VIC 3010, Australia; [Dooley, Kate; Nicholls, Zebedee; Meinshausen, Malte] Univ Melbourne, Climate & Energy Coll, Parkville, VIC 3010, Australia; [Nicholls, Zebedee] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal IIASA, Energy Climate & Environm ECE Program, Laxenburg, Austria; [Nicholls, Zebedee; Meinshausen, Malte] Climate Resource, Melbourne, VIC 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA),"Dooley, K (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog Earth & Atmospher Sci, Parkville, VIC 3010, Australia.;Dooley, K (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Climate & Energy Coll, Parkville, VIC 3010, Australia.",kate.dooley@unimelb.edu.au,"Meinshausen, Malte/AAG-6505-2019; Nicholls, Zebedee/GPW-9952-2022","Meinshausen, Malte/0000-0003-4048-3521; Nicholls, Zebedee/0000-0002-4767-2723",One Earth Philanthropy,One Earth Philanthropy,The authors would like to thank the two anonymous reviewers for invaluable feedback and suggestions that have strengthened this paper.

Although it is known that tropical deforestation is associated with local warming, the extent to which this additional heat exposure affects people across the tropics is unknown. In this modeling study, we combine worker health guidelines with satellite, reanalysis, and population data to investigate how warming associated with recent deforestation (2003-2018) affects outdoor working conditions across low-latitude countries, and how future global climate change will magnify heat exposure for people in deforested areas. We find that the local warming from 15 years of deforestation was associated with losses in safe thermal working conditions for 2.8 million outdoor workers. We also show recent large-scale forest loss was associated with particularly large impacts on populations in locations such as the Brazilian states of Mato Grosso and Para '. Future global warming and additional forest loss will magnify these impacts.","[Parsons, Luke A.; Zeppetello, Lucas R.

Global recognition of the ecosystem services that coastal habitats provide has led to an emphasis on cities to adopt nature-based solutions (NBS). However, a broad assessment of urban areas and their potential to conserve remaining coastal habitat has not been undertaken. Here we apply spatial analytics to investigate 5,096 coastal urban areas in tropical and subtropical regions within the distribution of mangroves, tidal flats, seagrass meadows, and coral reefs, and find <50% of urban areas have natural coastal habitats within their extent. Large conservation opportunities for urban areas exist within an adjacent 50 km buffer zone where a significant proportion (93%) of urban-influenced coastal habitat lies and where 26% is currently protected. Potential high-conservation areas across the globe provide a unique opportunity to increase the resilience of urbanizing coasts and NBS for long-term socioeconomic and conservation goals.","[Mazor, Tessa; Lovelock, Catherine E.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Mazor, Tessa] Dept Environm Land Water & Planning, Biodivers Div, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Friess, Daniel A.] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Geog, Singapore, Singapore; [Friess, Daniel A.; Huang, Danwei] Natl Univ Singapore, Ctr Nat Based Climate Solut, Singapore, Singapore; [Todd, Peter A.; Huang, Danwei; Nguyen, Nhung T.

Integrated ocean management (IOM) is a governance approach that is designed to address these threats in a coordinated way while ensuring equitable distribution of resources and a reduction in conflict between invested parties. There are, however, a confusing and often competing array of different approaches to IOM, which can inhibit the success of its application and undermine sustainability efforts. Here, we propose an NAE (normative, applied, and empirical) conceptual model and demonstrate the utility of this approach as a tool through which to categorize the many different IOM frameworks. In doing so, we identify that most IOM frameworks provide for insufficient integration across one or more focus areas. By identifying these gaps, we provide a means through which future ocean governance can support more comprehensive integration.","[Voyer, Michelle; Moyle, Catherine; Kuster, Christopher; Lewis, Anna; Quirk, Genevieve] Univ Wollongong, Australian Natl Ctr Ocean Resources & Secur, Wollongong, NSW, Australia; [Voyer, Michelle] Univ Washington, EarthLab, Nippon Fdn Ocean Nexus, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Lal, Kirti K.] Univ Wollongong, Sch Earth Atmospher & Life Sci, Wollongong, NSW, Australia",University of Wollongong; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Wollongong,"Voyer, M (corresponding author), Univ Wollongong, Australian Natl Ctr Ocean Resources & Secur, Wollongong, NSW, Australia.;Voyer, M (corresponding author), Univ Washington, EarthLab, Nippon Fdn Ocean Nexus, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",mvoyer@uow.edu.au,,"Voyer, Michelle/0000-0001-6170-9994",University of Wollongong's Global Challenges program,University of Wollongong's Global Challenges program,This research forms part of the Blue Futureskeystone project funded by the University of Wollongong's Global Challenges program.

Climate agreements, in line with the UNFCCC, encourage developed countries to provide funds to help developing countries adapt and mitigate. However, up to now, no financial incentive (FI) has been implemented, and it remains unclear to what extent FIs can increase net emissions reductions (ER). Here we investigate a restrictive form of FI, employing both behavioral experiments and game theoretical analysis. We show that FIs significantly increase both ER and social welfare in the absence of any binding enforcement. We also find that the more developed countries invest in FIs, the more developing countries mitigate. This induces developed countries to incentivize developing countries to adapt and mitigate via FIs, resulting in a net global increase in ER. Our results are robust to different monitoring periods, loss probabilities, and mitigation cost ratios.","[Dong, Yali; Ma, Shuangmei; Wang, Wen-Xu] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Syst Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Boyu] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Math Sci, Minist Educ, Lab Math & Complex Syst, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Pacheco, Jorge M.] Univ Minho, Ctr Biol Mol & Ambiental, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Pacheco, Jorge M.] Univ Minho, Dept Matemat & Aplicacoes, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Pacheco, Jorge M.] ATP Grp, P-2744016 Porto Salvo, Portugal",Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University; Universidade do Minho; Universidade do Minho,"Wang, WX (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Syst Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.;Zhang, BY (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Math Sci, Minist Educ, Lab Math & Complex Syst, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.;Pacheco, JM (corresponding author), Univ Minho, Ctr Biol Mol & Ambiental, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal.;Pacheco, JM (corresponding author), Univ Minho, Dept Matemat & Aplicacoes, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal.;Pacheco, JM (corresponding author), ATP Grp, P-2744016 Porto Salvo, Portugal.",zhangby@bnu.edu.cn; wenxuwang@bnu.edu.cn; jmpacheco@math.uminho.pt,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [72091511, 11975049, 71631002, 71771026, 71922004]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) Portugal [PTDC/MAT-APL/6804/2020, PTDC/CCI-INF/7366/2020, UIDB/04050/2020]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PTDC/CCI-INF/7366/2020, PTDC/MAT-APL/6804/2020] Funding Source: FCT",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) Portugal(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"We acknowledge the financial support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grants 72091511, 11975049, 71631002, 71771026, and 71922004), The Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China, and Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT) Portugal (grants PTDC/MAT-APL/6804/2020, PTDC/CCI-INF/7366/2020, and UIDB/04050/2020).

Yet, these concerns are often not represented in leading decision-support tools that have been used for assessing policies' environmental impacts. Focusing on a wide range of clean-air policies in India, we assess their political-feasibility scores on the basis of public opinion, market, and institutional considerations and then incorporate these scores into the evaluation of environmental impacts by using an integrated assessmentmodel (GAINS-South Asia). We demonstrate that although some policies with substantial potential to mitigate air pollution are also highly politically feasible (e.g., replacing solid fuels with cleaner fuels in households), others can be less politically feasible (e.g., banning agricultural waste burning). Because some clean-air policies co-reduce CO2 emissions and aerosols, considering varying degrees of political feasibility is particularly important in achieving air-pollution and climate objectives simultaneously because of its implications on the implementation scale and policy sequence.","[Peng, Wei] Penn State Univ, Sch Int Affairs, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Peng, Wei] Penn State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Kim, Sung Eun] Korea Univ, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Seoul 02841, South Korea; [Purohit, Pallav; Wagner, Fabian] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Energy Climate & Environm Program, A-2361 Laxenburg, Austria; [Urpelainen, Johannes] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Adv Int Studies, Initiat Sustainable Energy Policy, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Korea University; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Johns Hopkins University,"Peng, W (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Sch Int Affairs, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.;Peng, W (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",weipeng@psu.edu,"Kim, Sung Eun/AAY-1989-2021; Purohit, Pallav/I-3938-2019","Kim, Sung Eun/0000-0001-6799-4343; Purohit, Pallav/0000-0002-7265-6960; Peng, Wei/0000-0002-1980-0759",Penn State School of International Affairs; Korea University [K2009071],Penn State School of International Affairs; Korea University,"W.P. was partly supported by the summer research stipend from the Penn State School of International Affairs.

The global policy discourse increasingly emphasizes clean fuels, notably gas and electricity, but these are expensive, and their supply chains typically interrupted, especially in rural areas. As an alternative, this paper shows that fuel-efficient biomass stoves could contribute climate mitigation potentials in Sub-Saharan Africa that today exceed the total CO2-equivalent emissions of a medium-sized European country. Abatement costs of these solutions are low at $2 to $10 per ton CO2 equivalent. Furthermore, we highlight where emissions are greatest and demonstrate that cooking-related emissions may double by 2050. We argue that a rapid dissemination policy should be based on two crucial steps. First, fuel-efficient stoves should be field-tested region by region and adapted to satisfy local cooking needs. Second, cookstoves that have proven to be adopted by users should be heavily subsidized at scale to accelerate uptake.","[Bensch, Gunther; Jeuland, Marc; Peters, Joerg] RWI Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Climate & Dev Dept, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany; [Jeuland, Marc] Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Jeuland, Marc] Duke Global Hlth Inst, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Peters, Joerg] Univ Passau, Chair Dev Econ, Innstr 29, D-94032 Passau, Germany",RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Duke University; University of Passau,"Jeuland, M (corresponding author), RWI Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Climate & Dev Dept, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany.;Jeuland, M (corresponding author), Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Durham, NC 27708 USA.;Jeuland, M (corresponding author), Duke Global Hlth Inst, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",marc.jeuland@duke.edu,,"Ankel-Peters, Jorg/0000-0002-7835-8745; Bensch, Gunther/0000-0001-7964-7533",RWI-Leibniz Institute for Economic Research; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [011A1807A],RWI-Leibniz Institute for Economic Research; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"The authors acknowledge support from the RWI-Leibniz Institute for Economic Research, which provided travel and funding support to M.J. and therefore facilitated this collaboration.

Recent studies have revealed a gap between real-world fuel efficiency and results from laboratory tests, where off-cycle'' auxiliary devices, like air conditioning (AC) systems, are not turned on. AC consumes the most energy among all off-cycle devices; however, the exact contribution of AC to fuel consumption remains unclear. Here, by analyzing 1 million trip-level fuel efficiency records from China, we show that AC use when the temperature exceeds 25 degrees C increases gasoline consumption annually by 1.3%. The amount differs across car models, with those produced by Chinese manufacturers showing relatively lower AC efficiency. Improving AC efficiency could cost-effectively reduce CO2 emissions by 1.6-2.4 million tons in China every year. Therefore, we suggest integrating off-cycle devices into future fuel efficiency regulations, which will reveal the fuel efficiency gap, incentivize car manufacturers to develop high-efficiency devices, and further tap this emissions reduction potential.","[Zhang, Da] Tsinghua Univ, Inst Energy Environm & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Da] MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Gao, Jun; Wu, Xiaomeng; Zhang, Shaojun; Wu, Ye] Tsinghua Univ, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Sch Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Tang, Ding; Shi, Junye; Chen, Jiangping; Peng, Yinghong] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Shaojun; Wu, Ye] State Environm Protect Key Lab Sources & Control, Beijing, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Tsinghua University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Zhang, D (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Inst Energy Environm & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Zhang, D (corresponding author), MIT, Joint Program Sci & Policy Global Change, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;Zhang, SJ (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Sch Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Zhang, SJ (corresponding author), State Environm Protect Key Lab Sources & Control, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhangda@tsinghua.edu.cn; zhsjun@tsinghua.edu.cn,"Wu, Ye/O-9779-2015; Zhang, Shaojun/AAU-3131-2020","Zhang, Shaojun/0000-0002-2176-6174; Zhang, Da/0000-0002-0790-9298","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71690244, 71573152, 41977180, 52075325, 71722003]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC0212100]; MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China; MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change,"We are grateful to the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grants 71690244, 71573152, 41977180, 52075325, and 71722003) and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (grant 2017YFC0212100) for supporting this research at Tsinghua University and Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

However, a comprehensive understanding of where and how these window technologies can be installed to enable optimal energy savings under different climate conditions remains limited. Here we test window technologies using thousands of macroscale building-energy simulations for different climate zones and building designs to evaluate the associated net energy use and carbon-emissions reduction potential. Novel window technologies, especially photovoltaic windows with high thermal performance, offer energy savings in all climates, ranging from 10,000-40,000 GJ per year over substandard windows for a typical office building, resulting in up to 2,000 tons of annual CO2 emissions reduction.
