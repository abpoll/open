They find warming increases network complexity, which is strongly correlated with network stability. Unravelling the relationships between network complexity and stability under changing climate is a challenging topic in theoretical ecology that remains understudied in the field of microbial ecology. Here, we examined the effects of long-term experimental warming on the complexity and stability of molecular ecological networks in grassland soil microbial communities. Warming significantly increased network complexity, including network size, connectivity, connectance, average clustering coefficient, relative modularity and number of keystone species, as compared with the ambient control. Molecular ecological networks under warming became significantly more robust, with network stability strongly correlated with network complexity, supporting the central ecological belief that complexity begets stability. Furthermore, warming significantly strengthened the relationships of network structure to community functional potentials and key ecosystem functioning. These results indicate that preserving microbial 'interactions' is critical for ecosystem management and for projecting ecological consequences of future climate warming.","[Yuan, Mengting Maggie] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Yuan, Mengting Maggie; Guo, Xue; Wu, Linwei; Zhang, Ya; Xiao, Naijia; Ning, Daliang; Shi, Zhou; Zhou, Xishu; Wu, Liyou; Zhou, Jizhong] Univ Oklahoma, Inst Environm Genom, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Yuan, Mengting Maggie; Guo, Xue; Wu, Linwei; Zhang, Ya; Xiao, Naijia; Ning, Daliang; Shi, Zhou; Zhou, Xishu; Wu, Liyou; Zhou, Jizhong] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Microbiol & Plant Biol, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Guo, Xue; Yang, Yunfeng] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Shi, Zhou] Gladstone Inst & Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, CA USA; [Zhou, Xishu] Cent South Univ, Sch Minerals Proc & Bioengn, Minist Educ, Key Lab Biomet, Changsha, Peoples R China; [Tiedje, James M.] Michigan State Univ, Ctr Microbial Ecol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Zhou, Jizhong] Univ Oklahoma, Sch Civil Engn & Environm Sci, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Zhou, Jizhong] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Earth & Environm Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; Tsinghua University; Central South University; Michigan State University; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,"Zhou, JZ (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Inst Environm Genom, Norman, OK 73019 USA.;Zhou, JZ (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Dept Microbiol & Plant Biol, Norman, OK 73019 USA.;Zhou, JZ (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Sch Civil Engn & Environm Sci, Norman, OK 73019 USA.;Zhou, JZ (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Earth & Environm Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",jzhou@ou.edu,"Zhang, Yanwen/ABC-1901-2021; Guo, Xue/GLR-8229-2022; Shi, Zhou Jason/AAW-5365-2021; Wu, Linwei/GLR-8392-2022; Ning, Daliang/AAT-2601-2021; Yang, Yunfeng/H-9853-2013","Zhang, Yanwen/0000-0003-1833-3885; Guo, Xue/0000-0002-4309-6140; Yuan, Mengting/0000-0003-0017-3908; Zhang, Ya/0000-0002-1746-3437; Zhou, Jizhong/0000-0003-2014-0564; Ning, Daliang/0000-0002-3368-5988; Yang, Yunfeng/0000-0001-8274-6196","US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Genomic Science Program [DE-SC0004601, DE-SC0010715]; Office of the Vice President for Research at the University of Oklahoma; China Scholarship Council (CSC); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2018M641327, 2019T120101]","US Department of Energy, Office of Science, Genomic Science Program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Office of the Vice President for Research at the University of Oklahoma; China Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation)","We thank numerous former and current members in the Institute for Environmental Genomics for their help in maintaining the long-term field experiment.

To date, several forest carbon monitoring systems have been developed for different regions using various data, methods and assumptions, making it difficult to evaluate mitigation performance consistently across scales. Here, we integrate ground and Earth observation data to map annual forest-related greenhouse gas emissions and removals globally at a spatial resolution of 30 m over the years 2001-2019. We estimate that global forests were a net carbon sink of -7.6 +/- 49 GtCO(2)e yr(-1), reflecting a balance between gross carbon removals (-15.6 +/- 49 GtCO(2)e yr(-1)) and gross emissions from deforestation and other disturbances (8.1 +/- 2.5 GtCO(2)e yr(-1)). The geospatial monitoring framework introduced here supports climate policy development by promoting alignment and transparency in setting priorities and tracking collective progress towards forest-specific climate mitigation goals with both local detail and global consistency.","[Harris, Nancy L.; Gibbs, David A.] World Resources Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Baccini, Alessandro; Birdsey, Richard A.; Farina, Mary; Houghton, Richard A.] Woodwell Climate Res Ctr, Falmouth, MA USA; [de Bruin, Sytze; Herold, Martin; Suarez, Daniela Requena] Wageningen Univ & Res, Lab Geoinformat Sci & Remote Sensing, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Fatoyinbo, Lola] NASA Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Biospher Sci Lab, Greenbelt, MD USA; [Hansen, Matthew C.; Potapov, Peter V.; Turubanova, Svetlana A.; Tyukavina, Alexandra] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Roman-Cuesta, Rosa M.] Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Bogor, Indonesia; [Saatchi, Sassan S.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USA; [Saatchi, Sassan S.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Slay, Christy M.] Univ Arkansas, Sustainabil Consortium, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Baccini, Alessandro] Boston Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Boston, MA USA; [Farina, Mary] Montana State Univ, Dept Land Resources & Environm Sci, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA",Wageningen University & Research; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; CGIAR; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR); California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; Boston University; Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman,"Harris, NL (corresponding author), World Resources Inst, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",nharris@wri.org,"Herold, Martin/F-8553-2012; Tyukavina, Alexandra/AGW-0785-2022; potapov, peter/AAE-7388-2019; de Bruin, Sytze/N-1183-2014; Saatchi, Sassan/AAQ-2649-2021","Herold, Martin/0000-0003-0246-6886; potapov, peter/0000-0003-3977-0021; de Bruin, Sytze/0000-0002-6884-2832; Requena Suarez, Daniela/0000-0002-3081-6882; Gibbs, David/0000-0001-7389-8569; Tyukavina, Alexandra/0000-0003-3872-9844; Harris, Nancy/0000-0001-6661-4249; Slay, Christy/0000-0002-6775-2974","Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs [18/2721]; UK Department for International Development (DFID FGMC grant) [FGMC2018-21-WRI]; US Agency for International Development [7200AA19CA00027]; National Aeronautics and Space Administration Earth Science Division [NNH12ZDA001 NICESAT2, 12-ICESAT212-0022]; NASA Carbon Monitoring System Program Project 'Estimating Total Ecosystem Carbon in Blue Carbon and Tropical Peatland Ecosystems' [16- 30 CMS16-0073]; CIFOR's global comparative study on REDD+ - (NORAD); European Commission [776810, 821880]; United States Department of Agriculture's Forest Service",Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs; UK Department for International Development (DFID FGMC grant); US Agency for International Development(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); National Aeronautics and Space Administration Earth Science Division; NASA Carbon Monitoring System Program Project 'Estimating Total Ecosystem Carbon in Blue Carbon and Tropical Peatland Ecosystems'; CIFOR's global comparative study on REDD+ - (NORAD); European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); United States Department of Agriculture's Forest Service,"We thank S.

While historical TWS variations have been increasingly studied, future changes in TWS and the linkages to droughts remain unexamined. Here, using ensemble hydrological simulations, we show that climate change could reduce TWS in many regions, especially those in the Southern Hemisphere. Strong inter-ensemble agreement indicates high confidence in the projected changes that are driven primarily by climate forcing rather than land and water management activities. Declines in TWS translate to increases in future droughts. By the late twenty-first century, the global land area and population in extreme-to-exceptional TWS drought could more than double, each increasing from 3% during 1976-2005 to 7% and 8%, respectively. Our findings highlight the importance of climate change mitigation to avoid adverse TWS impacts and increased droughts, and the need for improved water resource management and adaptation.","[Pokhrel, Yadu;

Here, we use empirical data from 732 locations in 43 countries to estimate the mortality burdens associated with the additional heat exposure that has resulted from recent human-induced warming, during the period 1991-2018. Across all study countries, we find that 37.0% (range 20.5-76.3%) of warm-season heat-related deaths can be attributed to anthropogenic climate change and that increased mortality is evident on every continent. Burdens varied geographically but were of the order of dozens to hundreds of deaths per year in many locations. Our findings support the urgent need for more ambitious mitigation and adaptation strategies to minimize the public health impacts of climate change.","[Vicedo-Cabrera, A.

In the last 60 years, anthropogenic climate change has reduced agricultural total factor production globally by 21%, with stronger impacts in warmer regions. Agricultural research has fostered productivity growth, but the historical influence of anthropogenic climate change (ACC) on that growth has not been quantified. We develop a robust econometric model of weather effects on global agricultural total factor productivity (TFP) and combine this model with counterfactual climate scenarios to evaluate impacts of past climate trends on TFP. Our baseline model indicates that ACC has reduced global agricultural TFP by about 21% since 1961, a slowdown that is equivalent to losing the last 7 years of productivity growth. The effect is substantially more severe (a reduction of ~26-34%) in warmer regions such as Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean. We also find that global agriculture has grown more vulnerable to ongoing climate change.","[Ortiz-Bobea, Ariel] Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Ault, Toby R.; Carrillo, Carlos M.] Cornell Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Ithaca, NY USA; [Chambers, Robert G.] Univ Maryland, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Lobel, David B.] Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Lobel, David B.] Stanford Univ, Ctr Food Secur & Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Cornell University; Cornell University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Stanford University; Stanford University,"Ortiz-Bobea, A (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Charles H Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",ao332@cornell.edu,,"Ortiz-Bobea, Ariel/0000-0003-4482-6843; Lobell, David/0000-0002-5969-3476",,,,,55,163,166,85,340,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",1758-678X,1758-6798,,NAT CLIM CHANGE,Nat.

This Perspective highlights the opportunities and risks of e-fuels, and concludes that hydrogen and e-fuels should be prioritized for sectors inaccessible to direct electrification. E-fuels promise to replace fossil fuels with renewable electricity without the demand-side transformations required for a direct electrification. However, e-fuels' versatility is counterbalanced by their fragile climate effectiveness, high costs and uncertain availability. E-fuel mitigation costs are euro800-1,200 per tCO(2). Large-scale deployment could reduce costs to euro20-270 per tCO(2) until 2050, yet it is unlikely that e-fuels will become cheap and abundant early enough. Neglecting demand-side transformations threatens to lock in a fossil-fuel dependency if e-fuels fall short of expectations. Sensible climate policy supports e-fuel deployment while hedging against the risk of their unavailability at large scale. Policies should be guided by a 'merit order of end uses' that prioritizes hydrogen and e-fuels for sectors that are inaccessible to direct electrification.","[Ueckerdt, Falko; Dirnaichner, Alois; Everall, Jordan; Luderer, Gunnar] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany; [Bauer, Christian; Sacchi, Romain] Paul Scherrer Inst, Technol Assessment Grp, Villigen, Switzerland; [Everall, Jordan] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Wegener Ctr Climate & Global Change WEGC, Graz, Austria; [Luderer, Gunnar] Tech Univ Berlin, Global Energy Syst Anal, Berlin, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Paul Scherrer Institute; University of Graz; Technical University of Berlin,"Ueckerdt, F (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany.",falko.ueckerdt@pik-potsdam.de,"Luderer, Gunnar/G-2967-2012","Luderer, Gunnar/0000-0002-9057-6155; Ueckerdt, Falko/0000-0001-5585-030X; Everall, Jordan/0000-0002-2441-166X; Sacchi, Romain/0000-0003-1440-0905; Dirnaichner, Alois/0000-0002-3240-2608; Bauer, Christian/0000-0002-1083-9200",START project [FKZ03EK3046A]; Kopernikus-Ariadne project by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [FKZ 03SFK5A]; PSI's ESI platform,START project(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Kopernikus-Ariadne project by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; PSI's ESI platform,"We thank J.

Trees store carbon in biomass and soil but also alter the surface energy balance, warming or cooling the local climate. Mitigation scenarios and policies often neglect these biogeophysical (BGP) effects. Here we combine observational BGP datasets with carbon uptake or emission data to assess the end-of-century mitigation potential of forestation. Forestation and conservation of tropical forests achieve the highest climate benefit at 732.12 tCO(2)e ha(-1). Higher-latitude forests warm the local winter climate, affecting 73.7% of temperate forests. Almost a third (29.8%) of forests above 56 degrees N induce net winter warming if only their biomass is considered. Including soil carbon reduces the net warming area to 6.8% but comes with high uncertainty (2.9-42.0%). Our findings emphasize the necessity to conserve and re-establish tropical forests and consider BGP effects in policy scenarios. Forests take up carbon from the atmosphere but also change Earth's surface energy balance through biophysical effects. Accounting for these shows that tropical forests have the highest mitigation potential; the climate benefit of higher-latitude forests is offset by their warming effects in winter.","[Windisch, Michael G.; Davin, Edouard L.; Seneviratne, Sonia, I] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Windisch, Michael G.] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany; [Windisch, Michael G.] Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany; [Davin, Edouard L.] Univ Bern, Wyss Acad Nat Climate & Environm Phys, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Humboldt University of Berlin; University of Bern,"Windisch, MG; Davin, EL (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Atmospher & Climate Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.;Windisch, MG (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany.;Windisch, MG (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany.;Davin, EL (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Wyss Acad Nat Climate & Environm Phys, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland.",michael.gregory.windisch@alumni.ethz.ch; edouard.davin@wyssacademy.org,"Davin, Edouard L./L-7033-2016; Seneviratne, Sonia I./G-8761-2011","Davin, Edouard L./0000-0003-3322-9330; Seneviratne, Sonia I./0000-0001-9528-2917; Windisch, Michael/0000-0003-3085-9265",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF); German Aerospace Center (DLR); European Union [776608];  [01LS1905A],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); German Aerospace Center (DLR)(Helmholtz AssociationGerman Aerospace Centre (DLR)); European Union(European Commission); ,"We thank T.

This emerging megadrought, spanning 2000-2021, has been the driest 22-year period since the year 800 and 19% of the drought severity in 2021 can be attributed to climate change. A previous reconstruction back to 800 ce indicated that the 2000-2018 soil moisture deficit in southwestern North America was exceeded during one megadrought in the late-1500s. Here, we show that after exceptional drought severity in 2021, similar to 19% of which is attributable to anthropogenic climate trends, 2000-2021 was the driest 22-yr period since at least 800. This drought will very likely persist through 2022, matching the duration of the late-1500s megadrought.","[Williams, A.

Five years after the adoption of the Paris Climate Agreement, growth in global CO2 emissions has begun to falter. The pervasive disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic have radically altered the trajectory of global CO2 emissions.

A different definition-week-day heatwaves surpassing the current record by large margins-shows that their occurrence probabilities depend on warming rate, not level, and are higher than during recent decades. Recent climate extremes have broken long-standing records by large margins. Such extremes unprecedented in the observational period often have substantial impacts due to a tendency to adapt to the highest intensities, and no higher, experienced during a lifetime. Here, we show models project not only more intense extremes but also events that break previous records by much larger margins. These record-shattering extremes, nearly impossible in the absence of warming, are likely to occur in the coming decades. We demonstrate that their probability of occurrence depends on warming rate, rather than global warming level, and is thus pathway-dependent. In high-emission scenarios, week-long heat extremes that break records by three or more standard deviations are two to seven times more probable in 2021-2050 and three to 21 times more probable in 2051-2080, compared to the last three decades.

Here we use climate and integrated assessment models to estimate this effect on key renewables. Future potential and costs are quantified across two warming scenarios for eight technologies: utility-scale and rooftop photovoltaic, concentrated solar power, onshore and offshore wind energy, first-generation and lignocellulosic bioenergy, and hydropower. The generated cost-supply curves are then used to estimate energy system impacts. In a baseline warming scenario, the largest impact is increased availability of bioenergy, though this depends on the strength of CO2 fertilization. Impacts on hydropower and wind energy are uncertain, with declines in some regions and increases in others, and impacts on solar power are minor. In a future mitigation scenario, these impacts are smaller, but the energy system response is similar to that in the baseline scenario given a larger reliance of the mitigation scenario on renewables.","[Gernaat, David E.

The loss of forest area in the Brazilian Amazon was higher in 2019 than following drought and an El Nino event in 2015, yet degradation drove three times more biomass loss than deforestation from 2010 to 2019. Spatial-temporal dynamics of aboveground biomass (AGB) and forest area affect the carbon cycle, climate and biodiversity in the Brazilian Amazon. Here we investigate interannual changes in AGB and forest area by analysing satellite-based annual AGB and forest area datasets. We found that the gross forest area loss was larger in 2019 than in 2015, possibly due to recent loosening of forest protection policies. However, the net AGB loss was three times smaller in 2019 than in 2015. During 2010-2019, the Brazilian Amazon had a cumulative gross loss of 4.45 Pg C against a gross gain of 3.78 Pg C, resulting in a net AGB loss of 0.67 Pg C. Forest degradation (73%) contributed three times more to the gross AGB loss than deforestation (27%), given that the areal extent of degradation exceeds that of deforestation. This indicates that forest degradation has become the largest process driving carbon loss and should become a higher policy priority.","[Qin, Yuanwei; Xiao, Xiangming; Wu, Xiaocui; Doughty, Russell] Univ Oklahoma, Ctr Earth Observat & Modeling, Dept Microbiol & Plant Biol, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Wigneron, Jean-Pierre; Li, Xiaojun] INRA Nouvelle Aquitaine, UMR 1391, ISPA, Bordeaux Villenave Dorno, France; [Ciais, Philippe] Univ Paris Saclay, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, LSCE IPSL, CEA CNRS UVSQ, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Brandt, Martin] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Fan, Lei] Southwest Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Chongqing Jinfo Mt Karst Ecosyst Natl Observat &, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Crowell, Sean; Moore, Berrien] Univ Oklahoma, Coll Atmospher & Geog Sci, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Doughty, Russell] CALTECH, Div Geol & Planetary Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Zhang, Yao] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Climate & Ecosyst Sci Div, Berkeley, CA USA; [Liu, Fang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Sitch, Stephen] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter, Devon, England","University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of Copenhagen; Southwest University - China; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; California Institute of Technology; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; University of Exeter","Xiao, XM (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Ctr Earth Observat & Modeling, Dept Microbiol & Plant Biol, Norman, OK 73019 USA.;Wigneron, JP (corresponding author), INRA Nouvelle Aquitaine, UMR 1391, ISPA, Bordeaux Villenave Dorno, France.",xiangming.xiao@ou.edu; jean-pierre.wigneron@inrae.fr,"QIN, YUANWEI/GLQ-9472-2022; xiao, xiang/GWU-6035-2022; Qin, Yuanwei/HDN-6882-2022; Zhang, Yao/P-2009-2015; Sitch, Stephen A/F-8034-2015; Xiao, Xiao/IAN-3011-2023; Doughty, Russell/M-2499-2018; Wigneron, Jean-Pierre André/ABD-9939-2021; Li, Xiaojun/AFO-0620-2022; Brandt, Martin/E-4598-2015","Zhang, Yao/0000-0002-7468-2409; Sitch, Stephen A/0000-0003-1821-8561; Doughty, Russell/0000-0001-5191-2155; Wigneron, Jean-Pierre André/0000-0001-5345-3618; Li, Xiaojun/0000-0002-3831-4852; Xiao, Xiangming/0000-0003-0956-7428; Crowell, Sean/0000-0001-8353-3707; Qin, Yuanwei/0000-0002-5181-9986; Brandt, Martin/0000-0001-9531-1239; fan, lei/0000-0002-1834-5088","NASA Land Use and Land Cover Change programme [NNX14AD78G]; Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI) - US National Science Foundation [CRN3076, GEO-1128040]; NSF EPSCoR project [IIA-1301789]; NASA's GeoCarb Mission (GeoCarb) [80LARC17C0001]; SMOS project of the TOSCA Programme from CNES, France (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales); RECCAP2 project, ESA Climate Change Initiative [4000123002/18/I-NB]; H2020 European Institute of Innovation and Technology [821003]; Newton Fund through the Met Office Climate Science for Service Partnership Brazil (CSSP Brazil); European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [947757]; DFF Sapere Aude grant [9064-00049B]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41801247, 41830648]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20180806]; China Scholarship Council [201804910838]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA20010202]","NASA Land Use and Land Cover Change programme; Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI) - US National Science Foundation; NSF EPSCoR project; NASA's GeoCarb Mission (GeoCarb); SMOS project of the TOSCA Programme from CNES, France (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales); RECCAP2 project, ESA Climate Change Initiative; H2020 European Institute of Innovation and Technology; Newton Fund through the Met Office Climate Science for Service Partnership Brazil (CSSP Brazil); European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme(European Research Council (ERC)); DFF Sapere Aude grant; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences)","We thank P.

Most coastal populations live in subsiding areas and experience average rates of relative sea-level rise three to four times faster than due to climate change alone, indicating the need for policy to address subsidence. Climate-induced sea-level rise and vertical land movements, including natural and human-induced subsidence in sedimentary coastal lowlands, combine to change relative sea levels around the world's coasts. Although this affects local rates of sea-level rise, assessments of the coastal impacts of subsidence are lacking on a global scale. Here, we quantify global-mean relative sea-level rise to be 2.5 mm yr(-1) over the past two decades. However, as coastal inhabitants are preferentially located in subsiding locations, they experience an average relative sea-level rise up to four times faster at 7.8 to 9.9 mm yr(-1). These results indicate that the impacts and adaptation needs are much higher than reported global sea-level rise measurements suggest. In particular, human-induced subsidence in and surrounding coastal cities can be rapidly reduced with appropriate policy for groundwater utilization and drainage. Such policy would offer substantial and rapid benefits to reduce growth of coastal flood exposure due to relative sea-level rise.","[Nicholls, Robert J.] Univ East Anglia UEA, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Norwich, Norfolk, England;

However, the influence of land-atmosphere feedbacks on future P-E changes and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that soil moisture (SM) strongly impacts future P-E changes, especially in drylands, by regulating evapotranspiration and atmospheric moisture inflow. Using modelling and empirical approaches, we find a consistent negative SM feedback on P-E, which may offset similar to 60% of the decline in dryland P-E otherwise expected in the absence of SM feedbacks. The negative feedback is not caused by atmospheric thermodynamic responses to declining SM; rather, reduced SM, in addition to limiting evapotranspiration, regulates atmospheric circulation and vertical ascent to enhance moisture transport into drylands. This SM effect is a large source of uncertainty in projected dryland P-E changes, underscoring the need to better constrain future SM changes and improve the representation of SM-atmosphere processes in models.","[Zhou, Sha; Williams, A.

This is estimated for lake development under present-day and future warming scenarios, highlighting emerging hotspots and transboundary impacts. Warming on Earth's Third Pole is leading to rapid loss of ice and the formation and expansion of glacial lakes, posing a severe threat to downstream communities. Here we provide a holistic assessment of past evolution, present state and modelled future change of glacial lakes and related glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) risk across the Third Pole. We show that the highest GLOF risk is at present centred in the eastern Himalaya, where the current risk level is at least twice that in adjacent regions. In the future, GLOF risk will potentially almost triple as a consequence of further lake development, and additional hotspots will emerge to the west, including within transboundary regions. With apparent increases in GLOF risk already anticipated by the mid-twenty-first century in some regions, the results highlight the urgent need for forward-looking, collaborative, long-term approaches to mitigate future impacts and enhance sustainable development across the Third Pole.","[Zheng, Guoxiong; Bao, Anming; Li, Junli; Yuan, Ye; Jiang, Liangliang; Yu, Tao] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Urumqi, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Guoxiong; Allen, Simon Keith; Ballesteros-Canovas, Juan Antonio; Stoffel, Markus] Univ Geneva, Inst Environm Sci, Climat Change Impacts & Risks Anthropocene C CIA, Geneva, Switzerland; [Zheng, Guoxiong; Yuan, Ye; Jiang, Liangliang; Yu, Tao; Chen, Wenfeng] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Allen, Simon Keith] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Zurich, Switzerland; [Bao, Anming] CAS HEC, China Pakistan Joint Res Ctr Earth Sci, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Ballesteros-Canovas, Juan Antonio; Stoffel, Markus] Univ Geneva, Dept Earth Sci, Dendrolab Ch, Geneva, Switzerland; [Huss, Matthias] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Lab Hydraul Hydrol & Glaciol VAW, Zurich, Switzerland; [Huss, Matthias] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Huss, Matthias] Univ Fribourg, Dept Geosci, Fribourg, Switzerland; [Zhang, Guoqing; Chen, Wenfeng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Guoqing] CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Stoffel, Markus] Univ Geneva, Dept FA Forel Environm & Aquat Sci, Geneva, Switzerland","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Xinjiang Institute of Ecology & Geography, CAS; University of Geneva; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; University of Zurich; University of Geneva; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; University of Fribourg; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, CAS; University of Geneva","Bao, A (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Urumqi, Peoples R China.;Stoffel, M (corresponding author), Univ Geneva, Inst Environm Sci, Climat Change Impacts & Risks Anthropocene C CIA, Geneva, Switzerland.;Bao, A (corresponding author), CAS HEC, China Pakistan Joint Res Ctr Earth Sci, Islamabad, Pakistan.;Stoffel, M (corresponding author), Univ Geneva, Dept Earth Sci, Dendrolab Ch, Geneva, Switzerland.;Stoffel, M (corresponding author), Univ Geneva, Dept FA Forel Environm & Aquat Sci, Geneva, Switzerland.",baoam@ms.xjb.ac.cn; markus.stoffel@unige.ch,"Zheng, Guoxiong/AAX-3597-2021; Zhang, Guoqing/F-1438-2019; Huss, Matthias/O-1399-2019; Chen, Feng Wen/B-7923-2015","Zheng, Guoxiong/0000-0002-9126-8357; Zhang, Guoqing/0000-0003-2090-2813; Huss, Matthias/0000-0002-2377-6923; Chen, Feng Wen/0000-0002-9507-1711; li, jun li/0000-0002-1054-5966; Ballesteros Canovas, Juan A./0000-0003-4439-397X",Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA20030101]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFB0504204]; Swiss National Science Foundation [IZLCZ2_169979/1]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [21661132003]; China-Pakistan Joint Research Center on Earth Sciences,Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Key Research and Development Program of China; Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China-Pakistan Joint Research Center on Earth Sciences,"We thank all those who made any data used here freely available.

However, it is operationalized through social, political and economic systems. We identify seven attributes of net zero, which are important to make it a successful framework for climate action. The seven attributes highlight the urgency of emission reductions, which need to be front-loaded, and of coverage of all emission sources, including currently difficult ones. The attributes emphasize the need for social and environmental integrity. This means carbon dioxide removals should be used cautiously and the use of carbon offsets should be regulated effectively. Net zero must be aligned with broader sustainable development objectives, which implies an equitable net-zero transition, socio-ecological sustainability and the pursuit of broad economic opportunities. Net-zero emissions is more than a concept of physical climate science. It is implemented in social, political and economic contexts.

They find increased risk, as well as crop yield, at higher latitudes and predict major shifts in pathogen assemblages in the United States, Europe and China. Global food security is strongly determined by crop production. Climate change-induced losses to production can occur directly or indirectly, including via the distributions and impacts of plant pathogens. However, the likely changes in pathogen pressure in relation to global crop production are poorly understood. Here we show that temperature-dependent infection risk, r(T), for 80 fungal and oomycete crop pathogens will track projected yield changes in 12 crops over the twenty-first century. For most crops, both yields and r(T) are likely to increase at high latitudes. In contrast, the tropics will see little or no productivity gains, and r(T) is likely to decline. In addition, the United States, Europe and China may experience major changes in pathogen assemblages. The benefits of yield gains may therefore be tempered by the greater burden of crop protection due to increased disease and unfamiliar pathogens.","[Chaloner, Thomas M.; Gurr, Sarah J.; Bebber, Daniel P.] Univ Exeter, Dept Biosci, Exeter, Devon, England; [Gurr, Sarah J.] Univ Utrecht, Dept Biol, Utrecht, Netherlands",University of Exeter; Utrecht University,"Bebber, DP (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Dept Biosci, Exeter, Devon, England.",d.bebber@exeter.ac.uk,,"Bebber, Daniel/0000-0003-4440-1482; Chaloner, Thomas/0000-0003-1655-0560; Gurr, Sarah/0000-0002-4821-0635",BBSRC [BB/N020847/1] Funding Source: UKRI,BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)),,,48,86,87,34,113,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",1758-678X,1758-6798,,NAT CLIM CHANGE,Nat.

Results show 3,093 carbon clusters and 432 sinks in 85 countries and regions are selected to achieve 92 GtCO(2) mitigation by CCUS, 64% of which will be sequestered into sedimentary basins for aquifer storage and 36% will be used for CO2-EOR (enhanced oil recovery). Of the identified source-sink matching, 80% are distributed within 300 km and are mainly located in China, the United States, the European Union, Russia and India. The total cost is similar to 0.12% of global cumulative gross domestic product. Of countries with CO2-EOR, 75% will turn into profitable at the oil price over US$100 per barrel. These findings indicate our proposed layout is economically feasible. However, its implementation requires global collaboration on financial and technological transfer.","[Wei, Yi-Ming; Kang, Jia-Ning; Wang, Peng-Tao; Liang, Qiao-Mei; Liao, Hua; Yu, Biying] Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wei, Yi-Ming; Kang, Jia-Ning; Liang, Qiao-Mei; Liao, Hua; Yu, Biying] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wei, Yi-Ming; Kang, Jia-Ning; Liang, Qiao-Mei; Liao, Hua; Yu, Biying] Beijing Key Lab Energy Econ & Environm Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Lan-Cui; Hou, Juan-Juan] Beijing Normal Univ, Business Sch, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Qi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Rock & Soil Mech, State Key Lab Geomech & Geotech Engn, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Peng-Tao] China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Energy & Min Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Huang, Shi-Feng] China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, Beijing, Peoples R China","Beijing Institute of Technology; Beijing Institute of Technology; Beijing Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Wuhan Institute of Rock & Soil Mechanics, CAS; China University of Mining & Technology; China Institute of Water Resources & Hydropower Research","Wei, YM; Yu, BY (corresponding author), Beijing Inst Technol, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Wei, YM; Yu, BY (corresponding author), Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Management & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Wei, YM; Yu, BY (corresponding author), Beijing Key Lab Energy Econ & Environm Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Liu, LC (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Business Sch, Beijing, Peoples R China.",wei@bit.edu.cn; liulancui@163.com; yubiying_bj@bit.edu.cn,"LI, QI/F-5257-2011; Liang, Qiao-Mei/AAF-4556-2021; Liao, Hua/C-4931-2012","LI, QI/0000-0003-0679-4385; Liao, Hua/0000-0002-4835-927X; Yu, Biying/0000-0002-3108-2702","China's National Key RD Program [2016YFA0602603]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71622012, 71822401, 71521002, 72073014]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation [JQ19035]",China's National Key RD Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation),"We gratefully acknowledge the financial support of China's National Key R&D Program (grant no. 2016YFA0602603), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos. 71622012, 71822401, 71521002 and 72073014) and the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (grant no.

Near-global relative humidity decreases highlight the potential for green infrastructure and more efficient urban cooling mechanisms. Effective urban planning for climate-driven risks relies on robust climate projections specific to built landscapes. Such projections are absent because of a near-universal lack of urban representation in global-scale Earth system models. Here, we combine climate modelling and data-driven approaches to provide global multi-model projections of urban climates over the twenty-first century. The results demonstrate the inter-model robustness of specific levels of urban warming over certain regions under climate change. Under a high-emissions scenario, cities in the United States, Middle East, northern Central Asia, northeastern China and inland South America and Africa are estimated to experience substantial warming of more than 4 K-larger than regional warming-by the end of the century, with high inter-model confidence. Our findings highlight the critical need for multi-model global projections of local urban climates for climate-sensitive development and support green infrastructure intervention as an effective means of reducing urban heat stress on large scales.","[Zhao, Lei; Zheng, Zhonghua] Univ Illinois, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Urbana, IL 61820 USA; [Zhao, Lei] Univ Illinois, Natl Ctr Supercomp Applicat, Urbana, IL 61820 USA; [Oleson, Keith] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam Lab, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Bou-Zeid, Elie] Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Krayenhoff, E.

Integrated model-based analysis shows that strong interventions across many dimensions, together with ambitious lifestyle change, are needed to enable real progress towards the UN Agenda 2030. Ambitious climate policies, as well as economic development, education, technological progress and less resource-intensive lifestyles, are crucial elements for progress towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, using an integrated modelling framework covering 56 indicators or proxies across all 17 SDGs, we show that they are insufficient to reach the targets. An additional sustainable development package, including international climate finance, progressive redistribution of carbon pricing revenues, sufficient and healthy nutrition and improved access to modern energy, enables a more comprehensive sustainable development pathway. We quantify climate and SDG outcomes, showing that these interventions substantially boost progress towards many aspects of the UN Agenda 2030 and simultaneously facilitate reaching ambitious climate targets. Nonetheless, several important gaps remain; for example, with respect to the eradication of extreme poverty (180 million people remaining in 2030). These gaps can be closed by 2050 for many SDGs while also respecting the 1.5 degrees C target and several other planetary boundaries.","[Soergel, Bjoern; Kriegler, Elmar; Weindl, Isabelle; Rauner, Sebastian; Dirnaichner, Alois; Hofmann, Matthias; Bauer, Nico; Bertram, Christoph; Bodirsky, Benjamin Leon; Leimbach, Marian; Levesque, Antoine; Luderer, Gunnar; Pehl, Michaja; Baumstark, Lavinia; Beier, Felicitas; Dietrich, Jan Philipp; Humpenoeder, Florian; von Jeetze, Patrick; Klein, David; Koch, Johannes; Pietzcker, Robert; Strefler, Jessica; Lotze-Campen, Hermann; Popp, Alexander] Leibniz Assoc, Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Potsdam, Germany; [Kriegler, Elmar] Univ Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany; [Ruhe, Constantin] Goethe Univ, Frankfurt, Germany; [Ruhe, Constantin; Leininger, Julia; Wingens, Christopher] Deutsch Inst Entwicklungspolit DIE, German Dev Inst, Bonn, Germany; [Luderer, Gunnar] Tech Univ Berlin, Global Energy Syst Anal, Berlin, Germany; [Lotze-Campen, Hermann] Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; University of Potsdam; Goethe University Frankfurt; Deutsches Institut Entwicklungspolitik (DIE); Technical University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Soergel, B (corresponding author), Leibniz Assoc, Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Potsdam, Germany.",soergel@pik-potsdam.de,"Popp, Alexander/N-7064-2014; Humpenöder, Florian/HHN-1081-2022; Strefler, Jessica/O-7556-2015; Luderer, Gunnar/G-2967-2012; Rauner, Sebastian/D-4780-2015","Popp, Alexander/0000-0001-9500-1986; Humpenöder, Florian/0000-0003-2927-9407; Luderer, Gunnar/0000-0002-9057-6155; Soergel, Bjoern/0000-0002-2630-7081; Rauner, Sebastian/0000-0001-7618-9426; Bertram, Christoph/0000-0002-0933-4395; Pietzcker, Robert/0000-0002-9403-6711; Bauer, Nico/0000-0002-0211-4162; Dirnaichner, Alois/0000-0002-3240-2608; Beier, Felicitas Dorothea/0000-0002-8725-7663; Hofmann, Matthias/0000-0001-7259-8396",,,,,112,76,76,29,86,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",1758-678X,1758-6798,,NAT CLIM CHANGE,Nat.

This highlights the vulnerability of terrestrial carbon sinks and food security to increasing extreme events. Climate extremes such as droughts and heatwaves have a large impact on terrestrial carbon uptake by reducing gross primary production (GPP). While the evidence for increasing frequency and intensity of climate extremes over the last decades is growing, potential systematic adverse shifts in GPP have not been assessed. Using observationally-constrained and process-based model data, we estimate that particularly northern midlatitude ecosystems experienced a +10.6% increase in negative GPP extremes in the period 2000-2016 compared to 1982-1998. We attribute this increase predominantly to a greater impact of warm droughts, in particular over northern temperate grasslands (+95.0% corresponding mean increase) and croplands (+84.0%), in and after the peak growing season. These results highlight the growing vulnerability of ecosystem productivity to warm droughts, implying increased adverse impacts of these climate extremes on terrestrial carbon sinks as well as a rising pressure on global food security.","[Gampe, David; Buermann, Wolfgang] Augsburg Univ, Inst Geog, Augsburg, Germany; [Gampe, David] Ludwig Maximilian Univ Munich, Dept Geog, Munich, Germany; [Zscheischler, Jakob] Univ Bern, Climate & Environm Phys, Bern, Switzerland; [Zscheischler, Jakob] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, Bern, Switzerland; [Zscheischler, Jakob] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Computat Hydrosyst, Leipzig, Germany; [Reichstein, Markus] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Jena, Germany; [O'Sullivan, Michael] Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Exeter, Devon, England; [Smith, William K.] Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Tucson, AZ USA; [Sitch, Stephen] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter, Devon, England; [Buermann, Wolfgang] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Los Angeles, CA USA",University of Munich; University of Bern; University of Bern; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Max Planck Society; University of Exeter; University of Arizona; University of Exeter; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Gampe, D (corresponding author), Augsburg Univ, Inst Geog, Augsburg, Germany.;Gampe, D (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilian Univ Munich, Dept Geog, Munich, Germany.",david.gampe@googlemail.com,"Reichstein, Markus/A-7494-2011; Smith, William/HLW-4325-2023; OSullivan, Mike/HJY-6367-2023; Sitch, Stephen A/F-8034-2015; Zscheischler, Jakob/ABE-7324-2021","Reichstein, Markus/0000-0001-5736-1112; Smith, William/0000-0002-5785-6489; Sitch, Stephen A/0000-0003-1821-8561; Zscheischler, Jakob/0000-0001-6045-1629; Gampe, David/0000-0003-2493-7036",Swiss National Science Foundation [179876]; Helmholtz Initiative and Networking Fund (Young Investigator Group COMPOUNDX) [VH-NG-1537]; Newton Fund through the Met Office Climate Science for Service Partnership Brazil; NASA Terrestrial Ecosystems grant [80NSSC19M0103],Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Helmholtz Initiative and Networking Fund (Young Investigator Group COMPOUNDX); Newton Fund through the Met Office Climate Science for Service Partnership Brazil; NASA Terrestrial Ecosystems grant,"J.Z. has been supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation grant no. 179876 and the Helmholtz Initiative and Networking Fund (Young Investigator Group COMPOUNDX, grant no.

Deforestation and climate change, via increasing dry-season length and drought frequency, may already have pushed the Amazon close to a critical threshold of rainforest dieback. Here, we quantify changes of Amazon resilience by applying established indicators (for example, measuring lag-1 autocorrelation) to remotely sensed vegetation data with a focus on vegetation optical depth (1991-2016). We find that more than three-quarters of the Amazon rainforest has been losing resilience since the early 2000s, consistent with the approach to a critical transition. Resilience is being lost faster in regions with less rainfall and in parts of the rainforest that are closer to human activity. We provide direct empirical evidence that the Amazon rainforest is losing resilience, risking dieback with profound implications for biodiversity, carbon storage and climate change at a global scale. The Amazon rainforest is increasingly under pressure from climate change and deforestation. The resilience of three-quarters of the forest, particularly in drier areas or close to human activity, has been decreasing since the 2000s, indicating that the system may be approaching a tipping point.","[Boulton, Chris A.; Lenton, Timothy M.; Boers, Niklas] Univ Exeter, Global Syst Inst, Exeter, Devon, England; [Boers, Niklas] Tech Univ Munich, Sch Engn & Design, Earth Syst Modelling, Munich, Germany; [Boers, Niklas] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany",University of Exeter; Technical University of Munich; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung,"Boulton, CA (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Global Syst Inst, Exeter, Devon, England.",c.a.boulton@exeter.ac.uk,"Boers, Niklas/Q-8953-2018","Boers, Niklas/0000-0002-1239-9034; Boulton, Chris/0000-0001-7836-9391",Volkswagen Foundation; European Union [820970]; Leverhulme Trust [RPG-2018-046]; Alan Turing Institute [R-EXE-001],Volkswagen Foundation(Volkswagen); European Union(European Commission); Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust); Alan Turing Institute,We thank B.

Although the literature on adaptation to climate change is rapidly expanding, little is known about the actual extent of implementation. We systematically screened >48,000 articles using machine learning methods and a global network of 126 researchers. Our synthesis of the resulting 1,682 articles presents a systematic and comprehensive global stocktake of implemented human adaptation to climate change. Documented adaptations were largely fragmented, local and incremental, with limited evidence of transformational adaptation and negligible evidence of risk reduction outcomes. We identify eight priorities for global adaptation research: assess the effectiveness of adaptation responses, enhance the understanding of limits to adaptation, enable individuals and civil society to adapt, include missing places, scholars and scholarship, understand private sector responses, improve methods for synthesizing different forms of evidence, assess the adaptation at different temperature thresholds, and improve the inclusion of timescale and the dynamics of responses. Determining progress in adaptation to climate change is challenging, yet critical as climate change impacts increase. A stocktake of the scientific literature on implemented adaptation now shows that adaptation is mostly fragmented and incremental, with evidence lacking for its impact on reducing risk.","[Berrang-Ford, Lea; Callaghan, Max W.; Davis, Katy; Canosa, Ivan Villaverde; van Bavel, Bianca; Mosurska, Anuszka; Minx, Jan C.; Ford, James D.; Arotoma-Rojas, Ingrid] Univ Leeds, Priestley Int Ctr Climate, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Siders, A.

A collapse from the currently attained strong to the weak mode would have severe impacts on the global climate system and further multi-stable Earth system components. Observations and recently suggested fingerprints of AMOC variability indicate a gradual weakening during the last decades, but estimates of the critical transition point remain uncertain. Here, a robust and general early-warning indicator for forthcoming critical transitions is introduced. Significant early-warning signals are found in eight independent AMOC indices, based on observational sea-surface temperature and salinity data from across the Atlantic Ocean basin. These results reveal spatially consistent empirical evidence that, in the course of the last century, the AMOC may have evolved from relatively stable conditions to a point close to a critical transition. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is currently strong, but transition to its weak mode could see significant changes in the climate system. This work presents an observation-based early-warning system for such transitions and shows that the AMOC may be approaching a transition.","[Boers, Niklas] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Berlin, Germany; [Boers, Niklas] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany; [Boers, Niklas] Univ Exeter, Dept Math, Exeter, Devon, England; [Boers, Niklas] Univ Exeter, Global Syst Inst, Exeter, Devon, England",Free University of Berlin; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; University of Exeter; University of Exeter,"Boers, N (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Berlin, Germany.;Boers, N (corresponding author), Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany.;Boers, N (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Dept Math, Exeter, Devon, England.;Boers, N (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Global Syst Inst, Exeter, Devon, England.",boers@pik-potsdam.de,"Boers, Niklas/Q-8953-2018","Boers, Niklas/0000-0002-1239-9034",,,,,61,67,68,14,73,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",1758-678X,1758-6798,,NAT CLIM CHANGE,Nat.

Past and future changes in seasonal snow are of particular interest, as specifics at the scale of the full region are largely unknown. Here we combine models with observations to show that regional snowmelt is a more important contributor to streamflow than glacier melt, that snowmelt magnitude and timing changed considerably during 1979-2019 and that future snow meltwater supply may decrease drastically. The expected changes are strongly dependent on the degree of climate change, however, and large variations exist among river basins. The projected response of snowmelt to climate change indicates that to sustain the important seasonal buffering role of the snowpacks in high-mountain Asia, it is imperative to limit future climate change. High-mountain Asia streamflow is strongly impacted by snow and glacier melt. A regional model, combined with observations and climate projections, shows snowmelt decreased during 1979-2019 and was more dominant than glacier melt, and projections suggest declines that vary by river basin.","[Kraaijenbrink, Philip D.

This Perspective argues for community-driven model and observational improvement, emphasizing the need to understand natural aerosol processes and quantify how their baseline is changing. Mechanisms of Arctic amplification and Arctic climate change are difficult to pinpoint, and current climate models do not represent the complex local processes and feedbacks at play, in particular for aerosol-climate interactions. This Perspective highlights the role of aerosols in contemporary Arctic climate change and stresses that the Arctic natural aerosol baseline is changing fast and its regional characteristics are very diverse. We argue that to improve understanding of present day and future Arctic, more detailed knowledge is needed on natural Arctic aerosol emissions, their evolution and transport, and the effects on cloud microphysics. In particular, observation and modelling work should focus on the sensitivity of aerosol-climate interactions to the rapidly evolving base state of the Arctic.","[Schmale, Julia] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Architecture Civil & Environm Engn, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Zieger, Paul] Stockholm Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Stockholm, Sweden; [Zieger, Paul; Ekman, Annica M.

Observational work proposes temperature-driven daily snowmelt during the accumulation season as an alternative metric, with increases that are three times more widespread. In many mountainous regions, winter precipitation accumulates as snow that melts in the spring and summer, which provides water to one billion people globally. Climate warming and earlier snowmelt compromise this natural water storage. Although snowpack trend analyses commonly focus on the snow water equivalent (SWE), we propose that trends in the accumulation season snowmelt serve as a critical indicator of hydrological change. Here we compare long-term changes in the snowmelt and SWE from snow monitoring stations in western North America and find 34% of stations exhibit increasing winter snowmelt trends (P < 0.05), a factor of three larger than the 11% showing SWE declines (P < 0.05). Snowmelt trends are highly sensitive to temperature and an underlying warming signal, whereas SWE trends are more sensitive to precipitation variability. Thus, continental-scale snow water resources are in steeper decline than inferred from SWE trends alone. More winter snowmelt will complicate future water resource planning and management.","[Musselman, Keith N.; Molotch, Noah P.] Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Addor, Nans] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter, Devon, England; [Vano, Julie A.] Aspen Global Change Inst, Basalt, CO USA; [Molotch, Noah P.] Univ Colorado, Dept Geog, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Molotch, Noah P.] NASA, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Exeter; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL),"Musselman, KN (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",keith.musselman@colorado.edu,,"Addor, Nans/0000-0002-6057-3930",NASA Applied Sciences Water Resources Program [NNX17AF50G]; Swiss National Science Foundation [P400P2_180791],NASA Applied Sciences Water Resources Program; Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"K.N.M. and N.P.M. were supported by NASA Applied Sciences Water Resources Program under grant NNX17AF50G.

We hypothesize that lightning increases may induce a fire-vegetation feedback whereby more burning in Arctic tundra expedites the northward migration of boreal trees, with the potential to accelerate the positive feedback associated with permafrost soil carbon release. Changes in lightning activity are uncertain under climate change. The authors project that summer lightning in the Arctic is likely to more than double by the end of the century, with implications for lightning-strike tundra wildfires and associated carbon release from permafrost.","[Chen, Yang; Randerson, James T.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Romps, David M.; Seeley, Jacob T.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Romps, David M.; Riley, William J.; Mekonnen, Zelalem A.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Earth & Environm Sci, Berkeley, CA USA; [Veraverbeke, Sander] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Seeley, Jacob T.] Harvard Univ, Ctr Environm, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Harvard University,"Chen, Y (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",yang.chen@uci.edu,"Riley, William J/D-3345-2015; Mekonnen, Zelalem/M-7144-2017; Romps, David/F-8285-2011; Veraverbeke, Sander/H-2301-2012; Chen, Yang/C-6529-2008","Riley, William J/0000-0002-4615-2304; Mekonnen, Zelalem/0000-0002-2647-0671; Romps, David/0000-0001-7649-5175; Veraverbeke, Sander/0000-0003-1362-5125; Randerson, James/0000-0001-6559-7387; Chen, Yang/0000-0002-0993-7081","US Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science Biological and Environmental Research RUBISCO Science Focus Area; NGEE-Arctic project; NASA; US DOE Atmospheric System Research (ASR), an Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research programme; DOE [DE-AC0205CH11231]","US Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science Biological and Environmental Research RUBISCO Science Focus Area(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); NGEE-Arctic project; NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); US DOE Atmospheric System Research (ASR), an Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research programme; DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","This work was supported by the US Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science Biological and Environmental Research RUBISCO Science Focus Area (with funding to J.T.R, Z.A.M. and W.J.R.), the NGEE-Arctic project (with funding to Z.A.M. and W.J.R.) and NASA's Interdisciplinary Science (IDS) and Carbon Monitoring System (CMS) programmes (with grants to J.T.R and Y.C.).

An alternative index based on ecohydrological variables such as water limitation shows no global expansion of drylands. Drylands, comprising land regions characterized by water-limited, sparse vegetation, have commonly been projected to expand globally under climate warming. Such projections, however, rely on an atmospheric proxy for drylands, the aridity index, which has recently been shown to yield qualitatively incorrect projections of various components of the terrestrial water cycle. Here, we use an alternative index of drylands, based directly on relevant ecohydrological variables, and compare projections of both indices in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 climate models as well as Dynamic Global Vegetation Models. The aridity index overestimates simulated ecohydrological index changes. This divergence reflects different index sensitivities to hydroclimate change and opposite responses to the physiological effect on vegetation of increasing atmospheric CO2. Atmospheric aridity is thus not an accurate proxy of the future extent of drylands. Despite greater uncertainties than in atmospheric projections, climate model ecohydrological projections indicate no global drylands expansion under greenhouse warming, contrary to previous claims based on atmospheric aridity.","[Berg, Alexis; McColl, Kaighin A.] Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, 20 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [McColl, Kaighin A.] Harvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; Harvard University,"Berg, A (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, 20 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",alexis_berg@fas.harvard.edu,,,Winokur Seed Grant in Environmental Sciences from the Harvard University Center for the Environment,Winokur Seed Grant in Environmental Sciences from the Harvard University Center for the Environment,"We thank the World Climate Research Programme's Working Group on Coupled Modelling, which is responsible for CMIP, and we thank the climate modelling groups (listed in Supplementary Table 1 of this paper) for producing and making available their model output.

Here, we analyse trends in observed global extreme fire weather and their meteorological drivers from 1979 to 2020 using the ERA5 reanalysis. Trends in annual extreme (95th percentile) values of the fire weather index (FWI95), initial spread index (ISI95) and vapour pressure deficit (VPD95) varied regionally, with global increases in mean values of 14, 12 and 12%, respectively. Significant increases occurred over a quarter to almost half of the global burnable land mass. Decreasing relative humidity was a driver of over three-quarters of significant increases in FWI95 and ISI95, while increasing temperature was a driver for 40% of significant trends. Trends in VPD95 were predominantly associated with increasing temperature. These trends are likely to continue, as climate change projections suggest global decreases in relative humidity and increases in temperature that may increase future fire risk where fuels remain abundant. Climate change has led to increased fire activity in parts of the globe due to observed increases in fire weather extremes. These trends are driven predominantly by decreasing relative humidity and increasing temperature.","[Jain, Piyush] Nat Resources Canada, Northern Forestry Ctr, Canadian Forest Serv, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Castellanos-Acuna, Dante; Coogan, Sean C.

This highlights a risk in conservation strategies that devalue ephemerally warm habitats. A common goal of biological adaptation planning is to identify and prioritize locations that remain suitably cool during the summer. This implicitly devalues areas that are ephemerally warm, even if they are suitable most of the year for mobile animals. Here we develop an alternative conceptual framework, the growth regime, which considers seasonal and landscape variation in physiological performance, focusing on riverine fish. Using temperature models for 14 river basins, we show that growth opportunities propagate up and down river networks on a seasonal basis, and that downstream habitats that are suboptimally warm in summer may actually provide the majority of growth potential expressed annually. We demonstrate with an agent-based simulation that the shoulder-season use of warmer downstream habitats can fuel annual fish production. Our work reveals a synergy between cold and warm habitats that could be fundamental to support cold-water fisheries, and highlights the risk in conservation strategies that underappreciate warm habitats.","[Armstrong, Jonathan B.; Arismendi, Ivan] Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Fullerton, Aimee H.; Jordan, Chris E.] NOAA, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA USA; [Ebersole, Joseph L.] US EPA, Corvallis, OR USA; [Bellmore, J.

Here we use climate model simulations from the Detection and Attribution Model Intercomparison Project, as well as regularized optimal fingerprinting, to show that anthropogenic forcings caused 0.9 to 1.3 degrees C of warming in global mean near-surface air temperature in 2010-2019 relative to 1850-1900, compared with an observed warming of 1.1 degrees C.

Damages from drought in Europe will increase with losses more than euro65 billion per year in a scenario without climate mitigation; keeping warming below 2 degrees C avoids most impacts. While climate change will alter the distribution of water in time and space, quantifications of drought risk under global warming remain uncertain. Here, we show that in Europe, drought damages could strongly increase with global warming and cause a regional imbalance in future drought impacts. In the absence of climate action (4 degrees C in 2100 and no adaptation), annual drought losses in the European Union and United Kingdom combined are projected to rise to more than euro65 billion per year compared with euro9 billion per year currently, or two times larger when expressed relative to the size of the economy. Drought losses show the strongest rise in southern and western parts of Europe, where drought conditions at 4 degrees C could reduce regional agriculture economic output by 10%. With high warming, drought impacts will become a fraction of current impacts in northern and northeastern regions.

Limiting overshoot would require near-term investment but would result in longer-term economic benefit. Global emissions scenarios play a critical role in the assessment of strategies to mitigate climate change. The current scenarios, however, are criticized because they feature strategies with pronounced overshoot of the global temperature goal, requiring a long-term repair phase to draw temperatures down again through net-negative emissions. Some impacts might not be reversible. Hence, we explore a new set of net-zero CO2 emissions scenarios with limited overshoot. We show that upfront investments are needed in the near term for limiting temperature overshoot but that these would bring long-term economic gains. Our study further identifies alternative configurations of net-zero CO2 emissions systems and the roles of different sectors and regions for balancing sources and sinks. Even without net-negative emissions, CO2 removal is important for accelerating near-term reductions and for providing an anthropogenic sink that can offset the residual emissions in sectors that are hard to abate.","[Riahi, Keywan; Huppmann, Daniel; Rogelj, Joeri; Cabardos, Anique-Marie; Deppermann, Andre; Frank, Stefan; Fricko, Oliver; Fujimori, Shinichiro; Krey, Volker; Gusti, Mykola; Kishimoto, Paul; Uenlue, Gamze; van Ruijven, Bas; Zakeri, Behnam] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal IIASA, Laxenburg, Austria; [Riahi, Keywan] Graz Univ Technol, Graz, Austria; [Bertram, Christoph; Luderer, Gunnar; Humpenoeder, Florian; Kriegler, Elmar; Meinshausen, Malte; Popp, Alexander] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Potsdam, Germany; [Bertram, Christoph; Luderer, Gunnar; Humpenoeder, Florian; Kriegler, Elmar; Meinshausen, Malte; Popp, Alexander] Leibniz Assoc, Potsdam, Germany; [Rogelj, Joeri] Imperial Coll London, Grantham Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England; [Bosetti, Valentina] Bocconi Univ, Dept Econ, Milan, Italy; [Bosetti, Valentina] Bocconi Univ, IGIER, Milan, Italy; [Bosetti, Valentina; Drouet, Laurent; Tavoni, Massimo] Ctr Euro Mediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat, RFF CMCC European Inst Econ & Environm, Milan, Italy; [Fujimori, Shinichiro; Oshiro, Ken] Kyoto Univ, Dept Environm Engn, Nishikyo Ku, Katsura Campus, Kyoto, Japan; [Fujimori, Shinichiro; Hasegawa, Tomoko; Oshiro, Ken; Takakura, Junya] Natl Inst Environm Studies NIES, Ctr Social & Environm Syst Res, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Harmsen, Mathijs; van Vuuren, Detlef] PBL Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, The Hague, Netherlands; [Harmsen, Mathijs; van Vuuren, Detlef] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Hasegawa, Tomoko] Ritsumeikan Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Kyoto, Japan; [Krey, Volker] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Ind Ecol Programme & Energy Transit Initiat, Trondheim, Norway; [Luderer, Gunnar] Tech Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Paroussos, Leonidas; Vrontisi, Zoi; Fragkiadakis, Kostas] E3Modelling, Athens, Greece; [Schaeffer, Roberto; Rochedo, Pedro R.

Observation and simulation data across eastern China show increasing risks of compound events attributed to anthropogenic emissions and urbanization. Urban areas are experiencing strongly increasing hot temperature extremes. However, these urban heat events have seldom been the focus of traditional detection and attribution analysis designed for regional to global changes. Here we show that compound (day-night sustained) hot extremes are more dangerous than solely daytime or nighttime heat, especially to female and older urban residents. Urban compound hot extremes across eastern China have increased by 1.76 days per decade from 1961 to 2014 with fingerprints of urban expansion and anthropogenic emissions detected by a stepwise detection and attribution method. Their attributable fractions are estimated as 0.51 (urbanization), 1.63 (greenhouse gases) and -0.54 (other anthropogenic forcings) days per decade. Future emissions and urbanization would make these compound events two to five times more frequent (2090s versus 2010s), leading to a threefold-to-sixfold growth in urban population exposure. Our findings call for tailored adaptation planning against rapidly growing health threats from compound heat in cities.","[Wang, Jun; Yan, Zhongwei; Feng, Jinming] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Key Lab Reg Climate Environm Temperate East Asia, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yang; Zhai, Panmao] Chinese Acad Meteorol Sci, State Key Lab Severe Weather, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liao, Weilin] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [He, Guanhao] Guangdong Prov Inst Publ Hlth, Guangdong Prov Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Tett, Simon F.

Here, we use a historical atmospheric circulation-precipitation relationship to constrain future modelled wet-season precipitation over the Tibetan Plateau. Our constraint reduces precipitation increases to half of those from the unconstrained ensemble and reduces spread by around a factor of three. This constrained precipitation is used with estimated glacier melt contributions to constrain future runoff for seven rivers. We estimate runoff increases of 1.0-7.2% at the end of the twenty-first century for global mean warming of 1.5-4 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. Because population projections diverge across basins, this runoff increase will reduce the population fraction living under water scarcity conditions in the Yangtze and Yellow basins but not in the Indus and Ganges basins, necessitating improved water security through climate change adaptation policies in these regions at higher risk.","[Wang, Tao; Zhao, Yutong; Xu, Chaoyi; Liu, Dan; Piao, Shilong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Alpine Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Tao; Piao, Shilong; Yao, Tandong] Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yutong; Xu, Chaoyi] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ciais, Philippe; Yang, Hui] Univ Paris Saclay, CNRS, CEA, LSCE,IPSL,UVSQ,Lab Sci Climat & Environm, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Piao, Shilong] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Sino French Inst Earth Syst Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yao, Tandong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface P, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Peking University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, CAS","Wang, T (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Alpine Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Wang, T (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",twang@itpcas.ac.cn,"Ciais, Philippe/A-6840-2011","Ciais, Philippe/0000-0001-8560-4943; Xu, Chaoyi/0000-0003-1516-5767","Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Programme [2019QZKK0208]; NSFC project Basic Science Centre for Tibetan Plateau Earth System [41988101-04]; Key Research and Development Programmes for Global Change and Adaptation [2017YFA0603604]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41922004, 41871104]; Kathmandu Centre for Research and Education, Chinese Academy of Sciences-Tribhuvan University","Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Programme; NSFC project Basic Science Centre for Tibetan Plateau Earth System; Key Research and Development Programmes for Global Change and Adaptation; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Kathmandu Centre for Research and Education, Chinese Academy of Sciences-Tribhuvan University","This study was supported by the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Programme (2019QZKK0208), the NSFC project Basic Science Centre for Tibetan Plateau Earth System (41988101-04), Key Research and Development Programmes for Global Change and Adaptation (2017YFA0603604) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41922004 and 41871104).

The human pathogenic diseases and transmission pathways aggravated by climatic hazards are too numerous for comprehensive societal adaptations, highlighting the urgent need to work at the source of the problem: reducing GHG emissions.","[Mora, Camilo; Dean, Jacqueline M.; von Hammerstein, Hannah; Knudson, Tabatha A.; Setter, Renee O.; Webster, Kira M.; Franklin, Erik C.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Geog & Environm, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [McKenzie, Tristan] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Earth Sci, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [McKenzie, Tristan] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Marine Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Gaw, Isabella M.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Life Sci, Marine Biol Grad Program, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Smith, Charlotte Z.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Management, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Patz, Jonathan A.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Nelson Inst, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Patz, Jonathan A.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Populat Hlth Sci, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Franklin, Erik C.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Kaneohe, HI USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Gothenburg; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Mora, C (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Geog & Environm, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",cmora@hawaii.edu,"McKenzie, Tristan/HDM-8037-2022","Smith, Charlotte/0000-0001-8435-9018; Knudson, Tabatha/0000-0002-1253-6414; von Hammerstein, Hannah/0000-0002-4320-6960; Setter, Renee/0000-0002-6651-9054; Gaw, Isabella/0000-0002-2655-6221; Franklin, Erik/0000-0002-8660-3085",,,,,109,50,50,30,73,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",1758-678X,1758-6798,,NAT CLIM CHANGE,Nat.

Using new data on energy and GDP, we show that adopting the same near-term low-energy growth trajectory in all regions in IPCC scenarios limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees C presents an unresolved policy challenge. We discuss this challenge of combining energy demand reductions with robust income growth for the 6.4 billion people in middle- and low-income countries in light of the reliance of economic development on industrialization. Our results highlight the importance of addressing limits to energy demand reduction in integrated assessment modelling when regional economic development is powered by industrialization and of instead exploring faster energy supply decarbonization. Insights from development economics and other disciplines could help generate plausible assumptions given the financial, investment and stability issues involved. Climate policy calls for energy demand reduction on top of decarbonizing energy generation. Analysis of historical energy-income data shows that achieving these climate targets alongside economic development poses unresolved policy and modelling challenges, especially for developing countries.","[Semieniuk, Gregor.] Univ Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Semieniuk, Gregor.] SOAS Univ London, London, England; [Taylor, Lance; Foley, Duncan K.] New Sch Social Res, New York, NY 10011 USA; [Rezai, Armon] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria; [Rezai, Armon] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal IIASA, Laxenburg, Austria; [Rezai, Armon] Vienna Inst Int Econ Studies WIIW, Vienna, Austria",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; RLUK- Research Libraries UK; University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); The New School; Vienna University of Economics & Business; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies,"Semieniuk, G (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Semieniuk, G (corresponding author), SOAS Univ London, London, England.",gsemieniuk@umass.edu,"Semieniuk, Gregor/ABM-4335-2022","Rezai, Armon/0000-0002-6598-7307",Institute for New Economic Thinking,Institute for New Economic Thinking,L.T. and D.F. acknowledge support from the Institute for New Economic Thinking.,,72,50,51,9,67,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",1758-678X,1758-6798,,NAT CLIM CHANGE,Nat.

Here we apply an enhanced suite of global marine ecosystem models from the Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Model Intercomparison Project (Fish-MIP), forced by new-generation Earth system model outputs from Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), to provide insights into how projected climate change will affect future ocean ecosystems. Compared with the previous generation CMIP5-forced Fish-MIP ensemble, the new ensemble ecosystem simulations show a greater decline in mean global ocean animal biomass under both strong-mitigation and high-emissions scenarios due to elevated warming, despite greater uncertainty in net primary production in the high-emissions scenario.

How this cooling effect will respond to climate change is a leading source of uncertainty in climate sensitivity, the planetary warming resulting from CO2 doubling. Here, we observationally constrain this low cloud feedback at a near-global scale. Satellite observations are used to estimate the sensitivity of low clouds to interannual meteorological perturbations. Combined with model predictions of meteorological changes under greenhouse warming, this permits quantification of spatially resolved cloud feedbacks. We predict positive feedbacks from midlatitude low clouds and eastern ocean stratocumulus, nearly unchanged trade cumulus and a near-global marine low cloud feedback of 0.19 +/- 0.12 W m(-2) K-1 (90% confidence). These constraints imply a moderate climate sensitivity (similar to 3 K). Despite improved midlatitude cloud feedback simulation by several current-generation climate models, their erroneously positive trade cumulus feedbacks produce unrealistically high climate sensitivities. Conversely, models simulating erroneously weak low cloud feedbacks produce unrealistically low climate sensitivities.","[Myers, Timothy A.; Zelinka, Mark D.; Klein, Stephen A.; Caldwell, Peter M.] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Livermore, CA 94550 USA; [Scott, Ryan C.; Norris, Joel R.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Scott, Ryan C.] Sci Syst & Applicat Inc, Hampton, VA USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; Science Systems and Applications Inc,"Myers, TA (corresponding author), Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Livermore, CA 94550 USA.",myers74@llnl.gov,"Keyes, Dennis/AAZ-9285-2021; Klein, Stephen A/H-4337-2016; Zelinka, Mark/C-4627-2011; Norris, Joel/A-9785-2008","Klein, Stephen A/0000-0002-5476-858X; Zelinka, Mark/0000-0002-6570-5445; Myers, Timothy/0000-0003-0582-4554; Norris, Joel/0000-0003-4384-0977; Scott, Ryan/0000-0002-9182-0834; Caldwell, Peter/0000-0001-8604-0844",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [DE-AC52-07NA27344]; Regional and Global Model Analysis Program of the Office of Science at the DOE; National Aeronautics and Space Administration [80NSSC18K1020],United States Department of Energy (DOE)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Regional and Global Model Analysis Program of the Office of Science at the DOE; National Aeronautics and Space Administration(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"T.A.M., M.D.Z., S.A.K. and P.M.C. worked under the auspices of the United States Department of Energy (DOE), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under contract no.

Incorporating recent developments in inundation modelling, here we show a 26.4% (24.1-29.1%) increase in US flood risk by 2050 due to climate change alone under RCP4.5. Our national depiction of comprehensive and high-resolution flood risk estimates in the United States indicates current average annual losses of US$32.1 billion (US$30.5-33.8 billion) in 2020's climate, which are borne disproportionately by poorer communities with a proportionally larger White population. The future increase in risk will disproportionately impact Black communities, while remaining concentrated on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Furthermore, projected population change (SSP2) could cause flood risk increases that outweigh the impact of climate change fourfold. These results make clear the need for adaptation to flood and emergent climate risks in the United States, with mitigation required to prevent the acceleration of these risks. Climate change is increasing flood risk, yet models based on historical data alone cannot capture the impact.

The impact is influenced by sea surface temperature (SST), yet models disagree on how pIOD SST may respond to greenhouse warming. Here we find increased SST variability of strong pIOD events, with strong equatorial eastern Indian Ocean cool anomalies, but decreased variability of moderate pIOD events, dominated by western warm anomalies. This opposite response is detected in the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP5 and CMIP6) climate models that simulate the two pIOD regimes. Under greenhouse warming, the lower troposphere warms faster than the surface, limiting Ekman pumping that drives the moderate pIOD warm anomalies; however, faster surface warming in the equatorial western region favours atmospheric convection in the west, strengthening equatorial nonlinear advection that forces the strong pIOD cool anomalies. Climate extremes seen in 2019 are therefore likely to occur more frequently under greenhouse warming. The strength of a positive Indian Ocean Dipole (pIOD) is set by sea surface temperature gradient across the equatorial Indian Ocean. Modelling shows warming will increase strong pIODs but decrease moderate pIODs, as faster surface warming in the west sets up conducive conditions for the strong events.","[Cai, Wenju; Wu, Lixin; Wang, Guojian] Ocean Univ China, Inst Adv Ocean Studies, Key Lab Phys Oceanog, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Cai, Wenju; Wu, Lixin; Wang, Guojian] Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Cai, Wenju; Santoso, Agus; Ng, Benjamin; Wang, Guojian] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Ctr Southern Hemisphere Oceans Res CSHOR, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Yang, Kai; Huang, Gang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Huang, Gang] Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Reg Oceanog & Numer Modeling, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Santoso, Agus] Univ New South Wales, Australian Res Council ARC Ctr Excellence Climate, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Yamagata, Toshio] JAMSTEC, Applicat Lab, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan","Ocean University of China; Laoshan Laboratory; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Laoshan Laboratory; University of New South Wales Sydney; Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science & Technology (JAMSTEC)","Cai, WJ; Wu, LX (corresponding author), Ocean Univ China, Inst Adv Ocean Studies, Key Lab Phys Oceanog, Qingdao, Peoples R China.;Cai, WJ; Wu, LX (corresponding author), Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Qingdao, Peoples R China.;Cai, WJ (corresponding author), CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Ctr Southern Hemisphere Oceans Res CSHOR, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",wenju.cai@csiro.au; lxwu@ouc.edu.cn,"Ng, Benjamin/AAG-1306-2020; huang, gang/D-6427-2012; Yang, Kai/HOA-7144-2023; Wang, Guojian/AAF-9297-2020; Santoso, Agus/P-1918-2019; cai, wenju/C-2864-2012","Ng, Benjamin/0000-0002-4458-4592; huang, gang/0000-0002-8692-7856; Yang, Kai/0000-0003-0140-3111; Wang, Guojian/0000-0002-8881-7394; Santoso, Agus/0000-0001-7749-8124; cai, wenju/0000-0001-6520-0829","National Key RAMP;D Program of China [2018YFA0605700]; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41490643, 41490640, U1606402, 41521091]; Earth System and Climate Change Hub of the Australian Government's National Environment Science Program; CSHOR; NSFC [41831175, 91937302, CAS XDA20060501, COMS2019Q03]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2018M640168]; China Scholarship Council",National Key RAMP;D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Earth System and Climate Change Hub of the Australian Government's National Environment Science Program; CSHOR; NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"This work is supported by National Key R&D Program of China (grant no. 2018YFA0605700).

Here, we systematically assess the mitigation potential of demand-side options categorized into avoid, shift and improve, and their human well-being links. We show that these options, bridging socio-behavioural, infrastructural and technological domains, can reduce counterfactual sectoral emissions by 40-80% in end-use sectors. Based on expert judgement and an extensive literature database, we evaluate 306 combinations of well-being outcomes and demand-side options, finding largely beneficial effects in improvement in well-being (79% positive, 18% neutral and 3% negative), even though we find low confidence on the social dimensions of well-being. Implementing such nuanced solutions is based axiomatically on an understanding of malleable rather than fixed preferences, and procedurally on changing infrastructures and choice architectures. Results demonstrate the high mitigation potential of demand-side mitigation options that are synergistic with well-being. Evaluation of mitigation actions often focuses on cost and overlooks the direct effects on well-being. This work shows demand-side measures have large mitigation potential and beneficial effects on well-being outcomes.","[Creutzig, Felix; Niamir, Leila; Callaghan, Max; Minx, Jan C.] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Chang, Berlin, Germany; [Creutzig, Felix; Mattauch, Linus] Tech Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Bai, Xuemei] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Callaghan, Max; Lamb, William F.; Minx, Jan C.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Priestley Int Ctr Climate, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Cullen, Jonathan] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England; [Diaz-Jose, Julio] Univ Veracruzana, Veracruz, Mexico; [Figueroa, Maria] Copenhagen Business Sch, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Grubler, Arnulf] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Laxenburg, Austria; [Leip, Adrian] Joint Res Ctr, European Commiss, Ispra, Italy; [Masanet, Eric] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Mata, Erika] IVL Swedish Environm Res Inst, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Mattauch, Linus] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany; [Mattauch, Linus] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Mirasgedis, Sebastian] Nat Observ Athens, Athens, Greece; [Mulugetta, Yacob] UCL, London, England; [Nugroho, Sudarmanto Budi] Inst Global Environm Strategies, Takamatsu, Kagawa, Japan; [Pathak, Minal] Ahmedabad Univ, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India; [Perkins, Patricia] York Univ, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Roy, Joyashree] Asian Inst Technol, Bangkok, Thailand; [Roy, Joyashree] Jadavpur Univ, Kolkata, India; [de la Rue du Can, Stephane] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Berkeley, CA USA; [Saheb, Yamina] OpenExp, Paris, France; [Saheb, Yamina] Univ Lausanne, Fac Geosci & Environm, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Steg, Linda] Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; [Urge-Vorsatz, Diana] Cent European Univ, Budapest, Hungary",Technical University of Berlin; Australian National University; N8 Research Partnership; White Rose University Consortium; University of Leeds; University of Cambridge; Universidad Veracruzana; Copenhagen Business School; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; IVL Swedish Environmental Research Institute; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; University of Oxford; National Observatory of Athens; University of London; University College London; Ahmedabad University; York University - Canada; Asian Institute of Technology; Jadavpur University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of Lausanne; University of Groningen; Central European University,"Creutzig, F (corresponding author), Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Chang, Berlin, Germany.;Creutzig, F (corresponding author), Tech Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany.",creutzig@mcc-berlin.net,"Callaghan, Max W/I-1769-2019; de la Rue du Can, Stephane/ABI-1794-2020; Niamir, Leila/ABH-9839-2020; DÍAZ-JOSÉ, JULIO/AAQ-7253-2021; Steinberger, Julia K/B-3288-2011; Bai, Xuemei/A-5443-2012; Creutzig, Felix/B-8691-2016; Steg, Linda/H-6878-2014","Callaghan, Max W/0000-0001-8292-8758; de la Rue du Can, Stephane/0000-0001-8054-5737; Niamir, Leila/0000-0002-0285-5542; DÍAZ-JOSÉ, JULIO/0000-0003-0182-8814; Steinberger, Julia K/0000-0002-5925-9602; Leip, Adrian/0000-0001-7616-5029; Some, Shreya/0000-0002-7254-9970; Saheb, Yamina/0000-0002-3167-8194; Minx, Jan Christoph/0000-0002-2862-0178; Bai, Xuemei/0000-0001-6556-8041; Lamb, William F./0000-0003-3273-7878; Cullen, Jonathan M/0000-0003-4347-5025; Pathak, Minal/0000-0002-9474-0485; Creutzig, Felix/0000-0002-5710-3348; Steg, Linda/0000-0002-8375-9607","Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (Federal Ministry of Education and Research) [01LG1806A, 03SFK5J0, 01LG1910A]; Robert Bosch Foundation",Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung (Federal Ministry of Education and Research)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Robert Bosch Foundation,"We thank our workshop participants for their contribution and feedback.

These changes will impact ocean-atmosphere heat and carbon exchange, with implications for regional and global climate. Oceanic mesoscale eddies play a profound role in mixing tracers such as heat, carbon and nutrients, thereby regulating regional and global climate. Yet, it remains unclear how the eddy field has varied over the past few decades. Furthermore, climate model predictions generally do not resolve mesoscale eddies, which could limit their accuracy in simulating future climate change. Here we show a global statistically significant increase of ocean eddy activity using two independent observational datasets of surface mesoscale eddy variability (one estimates surface currents, and the other is derived from sea surface temperature). Maps of mesoscale variability trends show heterogeneous patterns, with eddy-rich regions showing a significant increase in mesoscale variability of 2-5% per decade, while the tropical oceans show a decrease in mesoscale variability. This readjustment of the surface mesoscale ocean circulation has important implications for the exchange of heat and carbon between the ocean and atmosphere.","[Martinez-Moreno, Josue; Hogg, Andrew McC.; Constantinou, Navid C.; Kiss, Andrew E.; Morrison, Adele K.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Martinez-Moreno, Josue; Hogg, Andrew McC.; Constantinou, Navid C.; Kiss, Andrew E.; Morrison, Adele K.] Australian Natl Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Extremes, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [England, Matthew H.] Univ New South Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [England, Matthew H.] Univ New South Wales, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Extremes, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Australian National University; Australian National University; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Martinez-Moreno, J (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Canberra, ACT, Australia.;Martinez-Moreno, J (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Extremes, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",josue.martinezmoreno@anu.edu.au,"Hogg, Andy McC./A-7553-2011; England, Matthew/A-7539-2011; Hogg, Andy/AAZ-8733-2021; Kiss, Andrew E/E-7733-2016; Moreno, Josué Martínez/AAM-7717-2021; Constantinou, Navid C/GVS-6295-2022; Morrison, Adele K/C-1774-2012","Hogg, Andy McC./0000-0001-5898-7635; England, Matthew/0000-0001-9696-2930; Hogg, Andy/0000-0001-5898-7635; Kiss, Andrew E/0000-0001-8960-9557; Moreno, Josué Martínez/0000-0002-8348-1588; Constantinou, Navid C/0000-0002-8149-4094; Morrison, Adele K/0000-0002-9904-4980","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT), Mexico; Australian Research Council DECRA Fellowship [DE170100184]; Australian Commonwealth Government; Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (QNLM); Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of New South Wales (UNSW); University of Tasmania (UTAS); Australian Research Council [DE170100184] Funding Source: Australian Research Council","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT), Mexico(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); Australian Research Council DECRA Fellowship(Australian Research Council); Australian Commonwealth Government(Australian Government); Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (QNLM); Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)); University of New South Wales (UNSW); University of Tasmania (UTAS); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council)","We thank R.

Here we offer a comprehensive, global and spatially explicit economic assessment of carbon sequestration and storage in three coastal ecosystem types at the global and national levels. We propose a new approach based on the country-specific social cost of carbon that allows us to calculate each country's contribution to, and redistribution of, global blue carbon wealth. Globally, coastal ecosystems contribute a mean +/- s.e.m. of US$190.67 +/- 30 bn yr(-1) to blue carbon wealth. The three countries generating the largest positive net blue wealth contribution for other countries are Australia, Indonesia and Cuba, with Australia alone generating a positive net benefit of US$22.8 +/- 3.8 bn yr(-)(1) for the rest of the world through coastal ecosystem carbon sequestration and storage in its territory. Blue carbon ecosystems take up and store substantial amounts of carbon.

Countries with greater climate change economic costs benefit most: a potential triple win for climate, biodiversity and society. The global impacts of biodiversity loss and climate change are interlinked, but the feedbacks between them are rarely assessed. Areas with greater tree diversity tend to be more productive, providing a greater carbon sink, and biodiversity loss could reduce these natural carbon sinks. Here, we quantify how tree and shrub species richness could affect biomass production on biome, national and regional scales. We find that GHG mitigation could help maintain tree diversity and thereby avoid a 9-39% reduction in terrestrial primary productivity across different biomes, which could otherwise occur over the next 50 years. Countries that will incur the greatest economic damages from climate change stand to benefit the most from conservation of tree diversity and primary productivity, which contribute to climate change mitigation. Our results emphasize an opportunity for a triple win for climate, biodiversity and society, and highlight that these co-benefits should be the focus of reforestation programmes.","[Mori, Akira S.; Okada, Kei-ichi] Yokohama Natl Univ, Fac Environm & Informat Sci, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Dee, Laura E.] Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Gonzalez, Andrew] McGill Univ, Quebec Ctr Biodivers Sci, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Ohashi, Haruka] Forest Res & Management Org, Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Dept Wildlife Biol, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Cowles, Jane; Isbell, Forest] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Wright, Alexandra J.] Calif State Univ Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA; [Loreau, Michel] CNRS, Theoret & Expt Ecol Stn, Moulis, France; [Hautier, Yann] Univ Utrecht, Dept Biol, Ecol & Biodivers Grp, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Newbold, Tim] UCL, Ctr Biodivers & Environm Res, Dept Genet Evolut & Environm, London, England; [Reich, Peter B.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN USA; [Reich, Peter B.] Western Sydney Univ, Hawkesbury Inst Environm, Penrith, NSW, Australia; [Matsui, Tetsuya] Forest Res & Management Org, Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Ctr Int Partnerships & Res Climate Change, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Takeuchi, Wataru] Univ Tokyo, Inst Ind Sci, Meguro Ku, Tokyo, Japan; [Okada, Kei-ichi] Tokyo Univ Agr, Fac Bioind, Abashiri, Hokkaido, Japan; [Seidl, Rupert] Tech Univ Munich, Sch Life Sci, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Seidl, Rupert] Berchtesgaden Natl Pk, Berchtesgaden, Germany",Yokohama National University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; McGill University; Forestry & Forest Products Research Institute - Japan; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; California State University System; California State University Los Angeles; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Utrecht University; University of London; University College London; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Western Sydney University; Forestry & Forest Products Research Institute - Japan; University of Tokyo; Tokyo University of Agriculture; Technical University of Munich,"Mori, AS (corresponding author), Yokohama Natl Univ, Fac Environm & Informat Sci, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.",akira.s.mori@gmail.com,"Reich, Paul/D-4321-2013; Newbold, Tim/R-8958-2019; Hautier, Yann/I-2526-2019; Mori, Akira S/A-6570-2013; Isbell, Forest/C-6915-2012; Newbold, Tim/D-1524-2012","Reich, Paul/0000-0003-1192-5909; Newbold, Tim/0000-0001-7361-0051; Hautier, Yann/0000-0003-4347-7741; Mori, Akira S/0000-0002-8422-1198; Isbell, Forest/0000-0001-9689-769X; Newbold, Tim/0000-0001-7361-0051; Ohashi, Haruka/0000-0001-8265-6107; Okada, Kei-ichi/0000-0001-6243-7353; Wright, Alexandra/0000-0002-5205-8576; Loreau, Michel/0000-0002-0122-495X; Dee, Laura/0000-0003-0471-1371",US National Science Foundation (NSF) Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network Communications Office [DEB-1545288]; Ichimura New Technology Foundation; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (ERTDF) of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency (ERCA) of Japan [JPMEERF15S11420]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [15KK0022]; US NSF CAREER award [DEB-1845334]; Liber Ero Chair in Biodiversity Conservation; TULIP Laboratory of Excellence [ANR-10-LABX-41]; ERTDF of the ERCA [JPMEERF20202002]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15KK0022] Funding Source: KAKEN,"US National Science Foundation (NSF) Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network Communications Office(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Ichimura New Technology Foundation; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (ERTDF) of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency (ERCA) of Japan; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); US NSF CAREER award(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)); Liber Ero Chair in Biodiversity Conservation; TULIP Laboratory of Excellence; ERTDF of the ERCA; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The paper was formed, analysed and written through workshops hosted by the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS), USA.

J,"Lin, YT; Qin, Y; Wu, J; Xu, MD",,,,"Lin, Yatang; Qin, Yu; Wu, Jing; Xu, Mandi",,,Impact of high-speed rail on road traffic and greenhouse gas emissions,NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CYCLE ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; CHINA,"Intercity high-speed rail (HSR) can have large climate benefits with its high energy efficiency. This study explores the substitution effects of HSR on road traffic in China, which can be translated to an annual reduction of 14.76 million tons of CO2-equivalent emissions. Carbon emission reduction in the transportation sector is essential in the global mitigation effort, and a large-scale public transport system has the potential to be an effective instrument. High-speed rail (HSR) is one such example, yet it is unclear how much reduction in road traffic results from new rail routes. Using the difference-in-differences method, we show that new HSR routes in China lead to a 20.5 log-point reduction in the number of passenger vehicles and a 15.7 log-point reduction in freight vehicles running on parallel highways. These reductions were not seen on ordinary national roads. These effects translate into an annual reduction of 14.76 million tons of CO2 equivalent of GHG emissions or 1.75% of GHG emissions in China's transport sector. This mitigation effect mainly comes from the substitution of highway goods transport with the conventional railway instead of the direct replacement of highway passenger transport with HSRs. The environmental benefit of HSR in China has not been fully realized because of the thermal-dominated electricity supply. Our further projections suggest that in greener electricity conditions, the HSR in China can substantially contribute more to the reduction in GHG emissions from the transport sector.","[Lin, Yatang] HKUST, Div Environm, Dept Econ, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lin, Yatang] HKUST, Div Social Sci, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Qin, Yu] Natl Univ Singapore, NUS Business Sch, Dept Real Estate, Singapore, Singapore; [Wu, Jing; Xu, Mandi] Tsinghua Univ, Hang Lung Ctr Real Estate, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wu, Jing; Xu, Mandi] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Construct Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; National University of Singapore; Tsinghua University; Tsinghua University,"Qin, Y (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, NUS Business Sch, Dept Real Estate, Singapore, Singapore.",bizqyu@nus.edu.sg,"Qin, Yu/T-8719-2019",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71874093, 91546113]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),We highly appreciate L.
