Here we show that the growing metaverse sector will facilitate climate change mitigation, through prospective analyses that systematically investigate five prominent metaverse-based applications for working, traveling, education, non-fungible token, and gaming. We find that the increasing metaverse adoption can reduce the global surface temperature by up to 0.02 degrees C before the end of this century and lower the greenhouse gas emissions by 10 Gt CO(2)e throughout the expansion period, based on different metaverse growth projections in the United States. The metaverse growth accelerates decarbonization and improves air quality, through alleviating air pollutant emissions by 10-23% and saving 10% of nationwide energy use by 2050 compared to the projections without further metaverse sector expansion. Therefore, it is suggested that the environmentally responsible adaptation of the metaverse growth requires transformations of domestic energy supply and benefits implementation of less aggressive climate policies.","[Zhao, Ning; You, Fengqi] Cornell Univ, Syst Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [You, Fengqi] Cornell Univ, Robert Frederick Smith Sch Chem & Biomol Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [You, Fengqi] Cornell Univ Ithaca, Cornell Atkinson Ctr Sustainabil, 340 Tower Rd, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University; Cornell University,"You, FQ (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Syst Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.;You, FQ (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Robert Frederick Smith Sch Chem & Biomol Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.;You, FQ (corresponding author), Cornell Univ Ithaca, Cornell Atkinson Ctr Sustainabil, 340 Tower Rd, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",fengqi.you@cornell.edu,"You, Fengqi/B-5040-2011","You, Fengqi/0000-0001-9609-4299",National Science Foundation (NSF) [CBET-1643244],National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work is based on work supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under Grant No. CBET-1643244 (to F.Y.).

Carbon capture using membrane-based technology offers an effective way to achieve controllable carbon emission and carbon neutrality.

In this Perspective, we focus on progress in advanced organic microporous membranes, with an emphasis on highlighting confined mass transport mechanisms, design principles and representative organic microporous membranes as well as their CO2 separation applications. First, we discuss the abnormal confinement effect in organic microporous membrane channels based on a physical/chemical confined mechanism to understand CO2 molecular transport behavior. Second, we propose three design principles, nano-assembly engineering, reticular engineering, and microenvironment engineering, to construct task-specific membrane structures. Third, we summarize four categories of organic microporous membrane materials, which are polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIM), graphene oxide (GO), metal-organic framework (MOF) and covalent organic framework (COF). Last, we provide a perspective on the opportunities and major challenges to achieve the transformation from advanced membranes to real-world applications.","[Wang, Yuhan; Jiang, Haifei; Guo, Zheyuan; Ma, Hanze; Wang, Shaoyu; Wang, Hongjian; Song, Shuqing; Wu, Hong; Jiang, Zhongyi] Tianjin Univ, Sch Chem Engn & Technol, Key Lab Green Chem Technol, Minist Educ, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Haifei; Zhang, Junfeng; Yin, Yan; Guiver, Michael D.] Tianjin Univ, Sch Mech Engn, State Key Lab Engines, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Zhongyi; Guiver, Michael D.] HaiHe Lab Sustainable Chem Transformat, Tianjin 300192, Peoples R China; [Guiver, Michael D.] Tianjin Univ, Natl Ind Educ Platform Energy Storage, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China",Tianjin University; Tianjin University; Tianjin University,"Jiang, ZY (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Sch Chem Engn & Technol, Key Lab Green Chem Technol, Minist Educ, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.;Guiver, MD (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Sch Mech Engn, State Key Lab Engines, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.;Jiang, ZY; Guiver, MD (corresponding author), HaiHe Lab Sustainable Chem Transformat, Tianjin 300192, Peoples R China.;Guiver, MD (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Natl Ind Educ Platform Energy Storage, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.",zhyjiang@tju.edu.cn; michael.guiver@outlook.com,"Song, Shuqing/HJH-7222-2023; Guiver, Michael D./I-3248-2016; ZHANG, Junfeng/F-8882-2011","Song, Shuqing/0000-0002-3514-3760; Guiver, Michael D./0000-0003-2619-6809; ZHANG, Junfeng/0000-0003-4723-2645; Yin, Yan/0000-0003-1655-6831","National Natural Science Foundation of China [U20B2023]; State Key Laboratory of Engines (SKLE), Tianjin University; National Industry-Education Platform of Energy Storage [21875161]; HaiHe Laboratory of Sustainable Chemical Transformations","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); State Key Laboratory of Engines (SKLE), Tianjin University; National Industry-Education Platform of Energy Storage; HaiHe Laboratory of Sustainable Chemical Transformations","The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. U20B2023).

This paper describes the open-source MEDEAS modeling framework, which has been developed with the aim of informing decision-making to achieve the transition to sustainable energy systems with a focus on biophysical, economic, social and technological restrictions and tackling some of the limitations identified in the current IAMs. MEDEAS models include the following relevant characteristics: representation of biophysical constraints to energy availability; modeling of the mineral and energy investments for the energy transition, allowing a dynamic assessment of the potential mineral scarcities and computation of the net energy available to society; consistent representation of climate change damages with climate assessments by natural scientists; integration of detailed sectoral economic structure (input-output analysis) within a system dynamics approach; energy shifts driven by physical scarcity; and a rich set of socioeconomic and environmental impact indicators. The potentialities and novel insights that this framework brings are illustrated by the simulation of four variants of current trends with the MEDEAS-world model: the consideration of alternative plausible assumptions and methods, combined with the feedback-rich structure of the model, reveal dynamics and implications absent in classical models. Our results suggest that the continuation of current trends will drive significant biophysical scarcities and impacts which will most likely derive in regionalization (priority to security concerns and trade barriers), conflict, and ultimately, a severe global crisis which may lead to the collapse of our modern civilization. Despite depicting a much more worrying future than conventional projections of current trends, we however believe it is a more realistic counterfactual scenario that will allow the design of improved alternative sustainable pathways in future work.","[Capellan-Perez, Inigo; de Blas, Ignacio; Nieto, Jaime; de Castro, Carlos; Javier Miguel, Luis; Carpintero, Oscar; Mediavilla, Margarita; Fernando Lobejon, Luis; Rodrigo, Paula; Frechoso, Fernando; Alvarez-Antelo, David] Univ Valladolid, Res Grp Energy Econ & Syst Dynam, Escuela Ingenierias Ind, Paseo Cauce S-N, E-47011 Valladolid, Spain; [Capellan-Perez, Inigo; de Blas, Ignacio; Javier Miguel, Luis; Mediavilla, Margarita] Univ Valladolid, Dept Syst Engn & Automat Control, Escuela Ingenierias Ind, Paseo Cauce S-N, E-47011 Valladolid, Spain; [Nieto, Jaime; Carpintero, Oscar; Fernando Lobejon, Luis] Univ Valladolid, Dept Appl Econ, Av Valle Esgueva 6, Valladolid, Spain; [de Castro, Carlos] Univ Valladolid, Dept Appl Phys, Escuela Arquitectura, Av Salamanca 18, Valladolid 47014, Spain; [Ferreras-Alonso, Noelia] CARTIF Fdn, Parque Tecnol Boecillo, Valladolid 47151, Spain",Universidad de Valladolid; Universidad de Valladolid; Universidad de Valladolid; Universidad de Valladolid,"Capellan-Perez, I (corresponding author), Univ Valladolid, Res Grp Energy Econ & Syst Dynam, Escuela Ingenierias Ind, Paseo Cauce S-N, E-47011 Valladolid, Spain.;Capellan-Perez, I (corresponding author), Univ Valladolid, Dept Syst Engn & Automat Control, Escuela Ingenierias Ind, Paseo Cauce S-N, E-47011 Valladolid, Spain.",inigo.capellan@uva.es,"Mediavilla, Margarita/G-7974-2017; Nieto, Jaime/AAC-6050-2020; Frechoso Escudero, Fernando A./L-4302-2014; Carpintero, Óscar/Q-9065-2016; de Blas, Ignacio/AAC-6413-2020; Miguel, Luis Javier/I-2829-2015; Capellán-Pérez, Iñigo/H-6069-2015","Mediavilla, Margarita/0000-0002-9898-7573; Nieto, Jaime/0000-0002-8925-4319; Frechoso Escudero, Fernando A./0000-0002-1119-9217; Carpintero, Óscar/0000-0001-9142-8931; Miguel, Luis Javier/0000-0002-8243-8596; Capellán-Pérez, Iñigo/0000-0002-3098-8027; Nieto Vega, Jaime/0000-0003-4843-250X; Ferreras-Alonso, Noelia/0000-0003-2843-6853; de Blas Sanz, Ignacio/0000-0002-4827-3839; LOBEJON, LUIS FERNANDO/0000-0002-7577-6933; Alvarez-Antelo, David/0000-0001-9738-3981","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [691287, 821105]; MODESLOW (Modeling and Simulation of scenarios towards a LOW-carbon transition: The Spanish case), a Spanish national research project under the Spanish National Research, Development and Innovation Program (Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain [ECO2017-85110-R]; Juan de la Cierva Research Fellowship of the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain [FJCI-2016-28833]","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme; MODESLOW (Modeling and Simulation of scenarios towards a LOW-carbon transition: The Spanish case), a Spanish national research project under the Spanish National Research, Development and Innovation Program (Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain; Juan de la Cierva Research Fellowship of the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain","The authors gratefully acknowledge Inaki Arto for assisting with the interpretation and use of the WIOD database, Robert W.

Here we reveal the conditions under which small-scale systems (NH3-leaves) based on the electrocatalytic reduction of nitrogen (eN(2)R) powered by photovoltaic energy could realise a decentralised scheme competitive in terms of environmental and economic criteria. For this purpose, we calculated energy efficiency targets worldwide, providing clear values that may guide research in the incipient eN(2)R field. Even at this germinal stage, the NH3-leaf technology would compete favourably in sunny locations for CO2-related Earth-system processes and human health relative to the business-as-usual production scenario. Moreover, a modest 8% gain in energy efficiency would already make them outperform the gHB in terms of climate change-related impacts in the sunniest locations. If no CO2 taxation is enforced, the lowest estimated ammonia production cost would be 3 times the industrial standard, with the potential to match it provided a substantial decrease of investment costs and very high selectivity toward ammonia in eN(2)R are achieved. The disclosed sustainability potential of NH3-leaf makes it a strong ally of gHB toward defossilised ammonia production.","[D'Angelo, Sebastiano C.; Martin, Antonio J.; Cobo, Selene; Guillen-Gosalbez, Gonzalo; Perez-Ramirez, Javier] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Chem & Bioengn, Dept Chem & Appl Biosci, Vladimir Prelog Weg 1, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Ordonez, Diego Freire] Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Proc Syst Engn, South Kensington Campus,Roder Hill Bldg, London SW7 2BY, England",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Imperial College London,"Guillen-Gosalbez, G; Perez-Ramirez, J (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Chem & Bioengn, Dept Chem & Appl Biosci, Vladimir Prelog Weg 1, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",gonzalo.guillen.gosalbez@chem.ethz.ch; jpr@chem.ethz.ch,"Martin Fernandez, Antonio Jose/AFB-6453-2022","Martin Fernandez, Antonio Jose/0000-0003-3482-8829; Cobo, Selene/0000-0002-2879-6261; Freire Ordonez, Diego/0000-0002-6789-426X; Perez-Ramirez, Javier/0000-0002-5805-7355",NCCR Catalysis [180544]; Swiss National Science Foundation,NCCR Catalysis; Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"This publication was created as part of NCCR Catalysis (grant number 180544), a National Centre of Competence in Research funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation.

On geological timescales, ocean uptake regulates atmospheric CO2 concentration, with two homeostats driving CO2 uptake: dissolution of deep ocean carbonate deposits (1 ka timescales) and terrestrial weathering of silicate rocks (100 ka timescales). Many current ocean-based CDR proposals effectively act to accelerate the latter. Here we present a method which relies purely on the redistribution and dilution of acidity from a thin layer of the surface ocean to a thicker layer of deep ocean, in order to reduce surface acidification and accelerate carbonate homeostasis. This downward transport could be seen analogous to the action of the natural biological carbon pump. The method offers advantages over other ocean alkalinity and CO2-stripping methods: the conveyance of mass is minimized (acidity is pumped in situ to depth), and expensive mining, grinding and distribution of alkaline material is eliminated. No dilute substance needs to be concentrated, reducing the quantity of seawater to be processed. Finally, no terrestrial material is added to the ocean, avoiding significant alteration of seawater ion concentrations or issues with heavy metal toxicity (encountered in mineral-based alkalinity schemes). The artificial transport of acidity accelerates the natural deep ocean compensation by calcium carbonate. It has been estimated that the total compensation capacity of the ocean is on the order of 1500 GtC. We show through simulation that pumping of ocean acidity could remove up to 150 GtC from the atmosphere by 2100 without excessive increase of local pH. The permanence of the CO2 storage depends on the depth of acid pumping. At >3000 m, similar to 85% is retained for at least 300 years, and >50% for at least 2000 years. Shallow pumping (<2000 m) offers more of a stop-gap deferral of emissions for a few hundred years. Uptake efficiency and residence time also vary with the location of acidity pumping. Requiring only local resources (ocean water and energy), this method could be uniquely suited to utilize otherwise-unusable open ocean energy sources at scale. We present a brief techno-economic estimate of 130-250$ per tCO(2) at current prices and as low as 93$ per tCO(2) under modest learning-curve assumptions.","[Tyka, Michael D.; Van Arsdale, Christopher; Platt, John C.] Google Inc, 601 N 34th St, Seattle, WA 98103 USA",Google Incorporated,"Tyka, MD (corresponding author), Google Inc, 601 N 34th St, Seattle, WA 98103 USA.",mike.tyka@gmail.com,"Platt, John/GOH-2678-2022","Van Arsdale, Christopher/0000-0001-8473-6725; Tyka, Michael/0000-0003-0108-6558; Platt, John/0000-0002-5652-5303",,,,,76,7,7,5,36,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",1754-5692,1754-5706,,ENERG ENVIRON SCI,Energy Environ.

Metals play an essential role in human life, and their demand will increase with global population and economic growth. Therefore, projecting future GHG emissions associated with metal production and exploring effective measures to alleviate GHG emissions are essential for achieving climate goals. This study projects the future GHG emissions associated with the primary and secondary production of six metals (aluminum, copper, iron, lead, nickel, and zinc) by considering the detailed metal cycles according to the shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs). Additionally, influential factors for GHG emissions in metal cycles are explored using decomposition and sensitivity analyses to reduce future GHG emissions. We show that future GHG emissions from metal production cannot be in line with the climate goal required to maintain the temperature change below 2 degrees C under any SSP, even though the trends for GHG emissions from metal production are significantly different among the SSPs. Therefore, substantial efforts to reduce GHG emissions are required in addition to the transition to the sustainable socio-economic pathway. From a short-term perspective, lowering the per capita in-use metal stock level and GHG emission intensity of metal production is crucial, especially in middle income groups. From a long-term perspective, improving the recycling rate is a possible step after sufficient in-use metal stocks are accumulated for recycling. To achieve the climate goals for both short- and long-term GHG reductions in metal cycles, a combination of actions on these influential factors without delay is essential.","[Yokoi, Ryosuke; Motoshita, Masaharu] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Res Inst Sci Safety & Sustainabil, 16-1 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058569, Japan; [Watari, Takuma] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Mat Cycles Div, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; [Watari, Takuma] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, 5-1-5 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778563, Japan",National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science & Technology (AIST); National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; University of Tokyo,"Yokoi, R (corresponding author), Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Res Inst Sci Safety & Sustainabil, 16-1 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058569, Japan.",r.yokoi@aist.go.jp,"Watari, Takuma/AAT-7126-2021; Motoshita, Masaharu/E-5483-2016; Yokoi, Ryosuke/P-1303-2019","Watari, Takuma/0000-0002-6072-3679; Motoshita, Masaharu/0000-0003-1576-0531; Yokoi, Ryosuke/0000-0001-5273-5787", [JSPS KAKENHI JP20K20014],,This research was partly supported by Grant-in-Aid for EarlyCareer Scientists (JSPS KAKENHI JP20K20014).,,80,20,20,7,35,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",1754-5692,1754-5706,,ENERG ENVIRON SCI,Energy Environ.

We leverage real-world consumption and operational data from a first-of-a-kind facility that meets heating, cooling and electrical energy requirements equivalent to a city of 30 000 people. Using our model, we compute optimal operational strategies for the controllable loads and thermal storage in this system under different economic hypotheses. In our example, electrifying the previously gas-based heating and cooling infrastructure has led to a 65% reduction in the overall campus carbon footprint. Through least-cost scheduling, the load shape of the aggregate energy system can be flattened and annual peak power demand can be reduced by 15%. Through carbon-aware scheduling that takes advantage of variations in grid power carbon intensity, heating and cooling emissions could further decrease by over 40% in 2025 compared to the 2016 baseline, assuming a policy-compliant electricity mix for California. However, rethinking electricity rates based on peak power usage will be needed to make carbon-aware scheduling economically attractive.","[de Chalendar, Jacques A.; Benson, Sally M.] Stanford Univ, Dept Energy Resources Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Glynn, Peter W.] Stanford Univ, Dept Management Sci & Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University; Stanford University,"de Chalendar, JA (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Energy Resources Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",jdechalendar@stanford.edu,,"de Chalendar, Jacques/0000-0002-3586-199X; Benson, Sally/0000-0002-3733-4296",Stanford's Global Climate Energy Project; State Grid Graduate Student Fellowship through Stanford's Bits & Watts initiative,Stanford's Global Climate Energy Project; State Grid Graduate Student Fellowship through Stanford's Bits & Watts initiative,"Funding for this research was supported by Stanford's Global Climate & Energy Project and a State Grid Graduate Student Fellowship through Stanford's Bits & Watts initiative.

Yet, to achieve this goal, there is a need to reduce their large energy demand. Employing semitransparent organic solar cells (OSCs) on greenhouse structures provide an opportunity to offset the greenhouse energy needs while maintaining the lighting needs of the plants. However, the design trade-off involved in optimizing solar power generation and crop productivity to maximize greenhouse economic value is yet to be studied in detail. Here, a functional plant growth model is integrated with a dynamic energy model that includes supplemental lighting to optimize the economics of growing lettuce and tomato. The greenhouse optimization considers 64 different OSC active layers with varying roof coverage for 25 distinct climates providing a global perspective. We find that crop yield is the primary economic driver, and that crop yield can be maintained in OSC-greenhouses across diverse climates. The crop productivity along with the energy produced by the OSCs results in improved net present value of the OSC-greenhouses relative to conventional systems in most climates for both lettuce and tomato. In addition, we find common solar cell active layers that maximize greenhouse economic value resulting in guidelines for scaling up OSC-greenhouse design. Through this model framework, we highlight the opportunity for OSCs in greenhouses, uncover designs and locations that provide the most value, and provide a basis for further development of OSC-greenhouses to achieve a sustainable means of food production.","[Ravishankar, Eshwar; Booth, Ronald E.; O'Connor, Brendan T.] NC State Univ, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Ravishankar, Eshwar; Booth, Ronald E.; O'Connor, Brendan T.] NC State Univ, Organ & Carbon Elect Labs ORaCEL, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Hollingsworth, Joseph A.; DeCarolis, Joseph F.] NC State Univ, Dept Civi4 Construct & Environm Engn, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Ade, Harald] NC State Univ, Dept Phys, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Ade, Harald] NC State Univ, ORaCEL, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Sederoff, Heike] NC State Univ, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, Raleigh, NC 27607 USA",North Carolina State University; North Carolina State University; North Carolina State University; North Carolina State University; North Carolina State University; North Carolina State University,"O'Connor, BT (corresponding author), NC State Univ, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.;O'Connor, BT (corresponding author), NC State Univ, Organ & Carbon Elect Labs ORaCEL, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",btoconno@ncsu.edu,"Ravishankar, Eshwar/AAK-8424-2021; Ade, Harald W/E-7471-2011; DeCarolis, Joseph F/F-4869-2013","Booth, Ronald/0000-0003-3080-9145; Ravishankar, Eshwar/0000-0001-8684-4113; Sederoff, Heike/0000-0002-0960-9678; DeCarolis, Joseph/0000-0003-4677-4522; Ade, Harald/0000-0002-1853-5471",National Science Foundation INFEWS award [CBET-1639429],National Science Foundation INFEWS award,The authors would like to acknowledge the National Science Foundation INFEWS award CBET-1639429 for support of this research.,,52,9,9,10,35,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",1754-5692,1754-5706,,ENERG ENVIRON SCI,Energy Environ.

To meet energy, economic, and environmental goals, society will have to identify vast volumes of high-capacity, low-cost, and viable storage reservoirs for sequestering CO2. In turn, this requires understanding how major geologic characteristics (such as reservoir depth, thickness, permeability, porosity, and temperature) and design and operational decisions (such as injection well spacing) impact CO2 injection rates, storage capacity, and economics. Although many numerical simulation tools exist, they cannot repeat the required thousands or millions of simulations to identify ideal reservoir properties and the sensitivity and interaction between geologic parameters and operational decisions. Here, we use SCO2T (pronounced Scott; S equestration of CO2 T ool)-a fast-running, reduced-order modeling framework-to explore the sensitivity of major geologic parameters and operational decisions to engineering (CO2 injection rates, plume dimensions, and storage capacities and effectiveness) and costs. Our results show, for the first time, benefits and impacts such as allowing CO2 plumes to overlap, how different well spacing patterns affect CO2 sequestration, the effects on costs of including brine treatment and disposal, and the effect of restricting injection rates to 1 MtCO(2) per y based on well limitations. We reveal multiple novel and unintuitive findings including: (i) deeper reservoirs have reduced carbon sequestration costs until injection rates reach 1 MtCO(2) per y, at which point deeper reservoirs become more expensive, (ii) thicker formations allow for increased injection rates and storage capacity, but thickness barely impacts plume areas, (iii) higher geothermal gradients result in reduced sequestration costs, unless brine treatment/disposal costs are included, at which point reservoirs having lower geothermal gradients are more economical because they produce less brine for each unit of injected CO2, and (iv) allowing plumes to overlap has a significantly positive impact of increasing storage capacities but has only a small influence on reducing sequestration costs. Overall, our results illustrate new scientific conclusions to help identify suitable sites to inject and store CO2, to help understand the complex interaction between geology and resulting costs, and to help support the pursuit of meeting global sequestration targets.","[Middleton, Richard S.; Chen, Bailian; Harp, Dylan R.] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Earth & Environm Sci, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; [Ogland-Hand, Jonathan D.] ETH, Dept Earth Sci, Zurich, Switzerland; [Bielicki, Jeffrey M.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Civil Environm & Geodet Engn, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Ellett, Kevin M.; Kammer, Ryan M.] Indiana Univ, Indiana Geol & Water Survey, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Ellett, Kevin M.] Indiana Univ, Pervas Technol Inst, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Los Alamos National Laboratory; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Middleton, RS (corresponding author), Los Alamos Natl Lab, Earth & Environm Sci, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA.",rsm@lanl.gov,"Middleton, Richard S/A-5470-2011; Bielicki, Jeffrey/D-4239-2016","Bielicki, Jeffrey/0000-0001-8449-9328; Ogland-Hand, Jonathan/0000-0002-3253-2576",US Department of Energy's (DOE) Fossil Energy Office project SimCCS: Development and Applications'' [FE-1017-18-FY18]; DOE Fossil Energy Office through the Carbon Utilization and Storage Partnership (CUSP) for the Western USA'' [DE-FE0031837]; DOE Fossil Energy Office through the Southeast Regional CO2 Utilization and Storage Acceleration Partnership (SECARB-USA)'' [DE-FE-0031830]; DOE Fossil Energy Office through the US-China Advanced Coal Technology Consortium'' [DE-PI0000017]; Los Alamos National Laboratory's Laboratory Directed Research Development program (LDRD) [20190057DR],US Department of Energy's (DOE) Fossil Energy Office project SimCCS: Development and Applications''(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); DOE Fossil Energy Office through the Carbon Utilization and Storage Partnership (CUSP) for the Western USA''; DOE Fossil Energy Office through the Southeast Regional CO2 Utilization and Storage Acceleration Partnership (SECARB-USA)''(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); DOE Fossil Energy Office through the US-China Advanced Coal Technology Consortium''(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Los Alamos National Laboratory's Laboratory Directed Research Development program (LDRD)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)Los Alamos National Laboratory),"This research was primarily funded by the US Department of Energy's (DOE) Fossil Energy Office project SimCCS: Development and Applications'' (Award No. FE-1017-18-FY18).

Nearly all other hydrogen is co-produced with other commodity chemicals. Unfortunately, many alternative, clean hydrogen production processes are small-scale because they require major reductions in capital cost or energy prices to be economical enough for industry. Because the climate problem is urgent, and the economics of future energy is uncertain, this paper seeks to expand the options for producing industrial-scale, clean hydrogen under common, present-day economic conditions. First, we build a model to understand the economic and carbon dioxide emissions constraints of sulfur electrolysis which is an emerging process that cogenerates hydrogen and co-salable sulfuric acid and has the potential to produce up to 36% of the world's current hydrogen demand under present-day, average US economic conditions. We also use our model to evaluate water electrolysis, which cogenerates hydrogen and waste oxygen, but is not economical under present-day average US economic conditions. We then propose criteria for identifying clean hydrogen production chemistries. Using these criteria, we find enough reactions to have the combined potential to make over 150% of the world's industrial hydrogen needs under present-day, average US economic conditions while reducing cost and reducing or eliminating CO2 emissions. Given the urgency of the climate problem, we believe that an economic analysis, such as this is crucial to near-term CO2 emissions reductions.","[Finke, Cody E.] LBNL, Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Finke, Cody E.; Leandri, Hugo F.; Karumb, Evody Tshijik] LBNL, Joint Ctr Artificial Photosynth, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Finke, Cody E.; Leandri, Hugo F.; Karumb, Evody Tshijik] Brimstone Energy Inc, Oakland, CA 94609 USA; [Leandri, Hugo F.; Zheng, David; Hoffmann, Michael R.] CALTECH, Linde Ctr Global Environm Sci, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Hoffmann, Michael R.; Fromer, Neil A.] CALTECH, Resnick Sustainabil Inst, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; California Institute of Technology; California Institute of Technology,"Finke, CE (corresponding author), LBNL, Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Finke, CE (corresponding author), LBNL, Joint Ctr Artificial Photosynth, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Finke, CE (corresponding author), Brimstone Energy Inc, Oakland, CA 94609 USA.",cody@brimstone.energy,,"Finke, Cody/0000-0002-1343-1737",Department of Energy's Advanced Manufacturing Office Cyclotron Road Program; Resnick Sustainability Institute at Caltech; Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-SC0004993],Department of Energy's Advanced Manufacturing Office Cyclotron Road Program; Resnick Sustainability Institute at Caltech; Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"Supporting data referenced above may be found in the ESI.dagger This work was supported by the Department of Energy's Advanced Manufacturing Office Cyclotron Road Program.

However, their deployment is still relatively limited, and their broader adoption will depend on their potential for cost reduction and performance improvement. Understanding this potential can inform critical climate change mitigation strategies, including public policies and technology development efforts. However, many existing estimates of past cost decline, which often serve as starting points for forecasting models, rely on limited data series and measures of technological progress. Here we systematically collect, harmonize, and combine various data series of price, market size, research and development, and performance of lithium-ion technologies. We then develop representative series for these measures, while separating cylindrical cells from all types of cells. For both, we find that the real price of lithium-ion cells, scaled by their energy capacity, has declined by about 97% since their commercial introduction in 1991. We estimate that between 1992 and 2016, real price per energy capacity declined 13% per year for both all types of cells and cylindrical cells, and upon a doubling of cumulative market size, decreased 20% for all types of cells and 24% for cylindrical cells. We also consider additional performance characteristics including energy density and specific energy. When energy density is incorporated into the definition of service provided by a lithium-ion battery, estimated technological improvement rates increase considerably. The annual decline in real price per service increases from 13 to 17% for both all types of cells and cylindrical cells while learning rates increase from 20 to 27% for all cell shapes and 24 to 31% for cylindrical cells. These increases suggest that previously reported improvement rates might underestimate the rate of lithium-ion technologies' change. Moreover, our improvement rate estimates suggest the degree to which lithium-ion technologies' price decline might have been limited by performance requirements other than cost per energy capacity. These rates also suggest that battery technologies developed for stationary applications, where restrictions on volume and mass are relaxed, might achieve faster cost declines, though engineering-based mechanistic cost modeling is required to further characterize this potential. The methods employed to collect these data and estimate improvement rates are designed to serve as a blueprint for how to work with sparse data when making consequential measurements of technological change.","[Ziegler, Micah S.; Trancik, Jessika E.] MIT, Inst Data Syst & Soc, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Trancik, Jessika E.] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); The Santa Fe Institute,"Trancik, JE (corresponding author), MIT, Inst Data Syst & Soc, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;Trancik, JE (corresponding author), Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA.",trancik@mit.edu,,"Ziegler, Micah/0000-0002-8549-506X",Alfred P.

Here we show how logistic growth models, a common tool in resource assessment, provide a mathematical framework for stakeholders to monitor short-term CCS deployment progress and long-term resource requirements in the context of climate change mitigation targets. Growth rate analysis, constrained by historic commercial CO(2)storage rates, indicates sufficient growth to achieve several of the 2100 storage targets identified in the assessment reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

In recent years, several energy harvesters that generate electricity using water have been invented due to their simplicity, sustainability, and eco-friendliness. Until now, the devices have required periodic supplementation of water for continuous electricity generation, which hinders their practical use. Here, we built an artificial hydrological cycle in a transpiration-driven electrokinetic power generator (TEPG) to continuously and autonomously generate electric power. The TEPG, composed of carbon-coated cotton fabric, generates electricity by using a few drops of water (0.2 mL); the electric power originates from the potential difference in the asymmetrically wetted device and the pseudostreaming current. However, after only one hour, the TEPG stops generating electricity, as water inevitably evaporates from the device. For continuous self-operation, we utilized calcium chloride (CaCl2), a typical deliquescent chemical, to collect water vapor from the surrounding environment and continuously supply water to the TEPG. In the range of 15-60% relative humidity (RH), CaCl2 successfully compensates for the water loss by evaporation and maintains the electrical power generation in the closed system.

Efforts to improve the efficiency of aircraft propulsion systems are leading to small, power-dense engine cores with higher overall pressure ratios and combustion temperatures, which can result in higher NOx emissions. The trend towards smaller engine cores with smaller mass flow rates in the core stream, presents new opportunities for emissions control. Specifically, we propose and assess using a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system that was previously infeasible when mass flow rates in the core were an order of magnitude larger than heavy-duty diesel engines for road based applications. SCR systems would reduce NOx emissions at the cost of increased aircraft weight and specific fuel consumption due to the pressure drop in the core stream induced by the catalyst. We quantify the effects of these trade-offs in terms of emissions reduction and fuel burn increase using representative engine cycle models provided by a major aero-gas turbine manufacturer. Due to its size, any SCR system will likely need to be housed in the aircraft body, potentially making it most suitable for future hybrid- or turbo-electric aircraft designs. Furthermore, SCR systems require ultra-low sulfur (ULS) fuel to prevent catalytic fouling. We find that employing an ammonia-based SCR results in an approximately 95% reduction in NOx emissions in exchange for a similar to 0.5% increase in block fuel burn. The performance of the post-combustion emissions control (PCEC) system is shown to improve for smaller-core engines, such as those proposed in the NASA N + 3 time-line (2030-2035). Using a global chemistry-transport model we estimate that PCEC used with ULS fuel, could avert similar to 92% of aviation air pollution related early deaths each year. Using a simplified climate model and accounting for changes in emissions (including life cycle emissions) and radiative forcing we estimate that PCEC with ULS fuel increases climate damages by similar to 7.5%. We estimate that the net benefit of using PCEC accounting for air quality and climate impacts is 304 USD (2015) per metric tonne of jet fuel burned, or a reduction of similar to 52% in monetized air quality and climate damages.","[Prashanth, Prakash; Speth, Raymond L.; Eastham, Sebastian D.; Sabnis, Jayant S.; Barrett, Steven R.

Lignocellulosic biomass-derived jet fuel blendstocks can contribute to the shift toward renewable, low-carbon energy sources for aircrafts. Producing these renewable jet fuel molecules from biomass requires advanced pathways with the potential for efficient and affordable conversion routes. This paper presents a detailed techno-economic analysis and sensitivity analysis, including estimated minimum selling price (MSP), and life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation costs for five routes to four potential bio-jet fuel molecules - limonane via limonene, limonane via 1,8-cineole, tetrahydromethylcyclopentadiene dimer (RJ-4), bisabolane, and epi-isozizaane. The simulated biorefineries utilize biomass sorghum and an integrated high-gravity ionic liquid-based biomass deconstruction process. We present results reflecting the current state of the technology and potential future scenarios with improved yields. Among the conversion pathways and the fuel molecules evaluated in this study, limonane, bisabolane, and epi-isozizaane could reach an MSP of $0.73-$0.91 per L-Jet A ($2.75-$3.45 per gal-Jet A) in optimized future cases, without a hypothetical lignin-derived co-product. RJ-4 requires a more costly upgrading process and catalysts, resulting in a comparatively higher MSP ($1.33 per L-Jet A or $5.04 per gal-jet A). Based on the GHG footprints of each fuel, the minimum achievable carbon mitigation cost relative to conventional Jet-A is $29 per metric ton CO2e, which is just under double the current cap-and-trade market price in California. In the absence of any policy support, the economics could be improved through high-value uses for lignin. To reach a target selling price of $0.66 per L-Jet A ($2.50 per gal), lignin-derived products would need to be sold for at least $1.9 per kg. However, the higher energy density of these bio-based blendstocks offers valuable improvements in aircraft efficiency/range; we find that commercial airlines may be willing to pay a 4-14 cent per L premium for these bio-jet fuels. Our results highlight the need for improvements beyond currently-reported yields for the biologically produced intermediates, identification of ideal microbial hosts, selection of metabolic pathways to achieve competitive production costs, and a focus on fuels with attractive properties that increase their value.","[Baral, Nawa Raj; Kavvada, Olga; Mendez-Perez, Daniel; Mukhopadhyay, Aindrila; Lee, Taek Soon; Simmons, Blake A.; Scown, Corinne D.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Joint BioEnergy Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Baral, Nawa Raj; Mendez-Perez, Daniel; Mukhopadhyay, Aindrila; Lee, Taek Soon; Simmons, Blake A.; Scown, Corinne D.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Biol Syst & Engn Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kavvada, Olga; Scown, Corinne D.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Anal & Environm Impacts Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Joint BioEnergy Institute - JBEI; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,"Scown, CD (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Joint BioEnergy Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Scown, CD (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Biol Syst & Engn Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Scown, CD (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Anal & Environm Impacts Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",cdscown@lbl.gov,"Mukhopadhyay, Aindrila/AAW-7257-2021; Simmons, Blake/N-6022-2016; Scown, Corinne/D-1253-2013; Scown, Corinne/W-9307-2019; Baral, Nawa Raj/H-6232-2018","Simmons, Blake/0000-0002-1332-1810; Scown, Corinne/0000-0003-2078-1126; Baral, Nawa Raj/0000-0002-0942-9183; Lee, Taek Soon/0000-0002-0764-2626; Mukhopadhyay, Aindrila/0000-0002-6513-7425","U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research [DE-AC02-05CH11231]","U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","We thank Ben Harvey for his invaluable feedback, N.

The aim is to provide high-quality freshwater to water-stressed and disaster-stricken communities even in the absence of energy infrastructure. The major key drivers behind the development of these technologies are the low cost of materials, the flexibility of the technology, the sustainability of the freshwater production, and the long-term stability of the device performance. However, the main challenge is to achieve stable performance by either preventing or mitigating salt accumulation during the desalination process. We present a multistage passive solar distiller whose key-strength is an optimized geometry leading to enhanced water yield (as compared to similar state of the art technologies) and spontaneous salt rejection. A comprehensive theoretical study is conducted to explain the apparently paradoxical experimental effective transport exceeding classical diffusion by two orders of magnitude. In our study, the Marangoni effect is included at the water-air interface and it stems from spatial gradients of surface tension. Interestingly, theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the device is able to reject overnight all the salt accumulated on each evaporator during daytime operation. Furthermore, under realistic conditions, a distillate flow rate of almost 2 L m(-2)h(-1)from seawater at less than one sun illumination has been experimentally observed. The reported mechanism of the enhanced salt rejection process may have tremendous implications in the desalination field as it paves the way to the design of a new generation of hydrophilic and porous materials for passive thermal desalination. We envision that such a technology can help provide cheap drinking water, in a robust way, during emergency conditions, while maintaining stable performance over a long time.","[Morciano, Matteo; Fasano, Matteo; Chiavazzo, Eliodoro; Asinari, Pietro] Politecn Torino, Dept Energy, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy; [Morciano, Matteo; Fasano, Matteo] Politecn Torino, Clean Water Ctr, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy; [Morciano, Matteo; Boriskina, Svetlana V.] MIT, Dept Mech Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Asinari, Pietro] INRIM Ist Nazl Ric Metrol, Str Cacce 91, I-10135 Turin, Italy",Polytechnic University of Turin; Polytechnic University of Turin; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica (INRIM),"Fasano, M; Chiavazzo, E; Asinari, P (corresponding author), Politecn Torino, Dept Energy, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy.;Fasano, M (corresponding author), Politecn Torino, Clean Water Ctr, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy.;Asinari, P (corresponding author), INRIM Ist Nazl Ric Metrol, Str Cacce 91, I-10135 Turin, Italy.",matteo.fasano@polito.it; eliodoro.chiavazzo@polito.it; pietro.asinari@polito.it,"Asinari, Pietro/C-5297-2012; Boriskina, Svetlana V/HJB-2983-2022; Fasano, Matteo/HJI-8843-2023; Morciano, Matteo/AAY-1361-2021","Asinari, Pietro/0000-0003-1814-3846; Boriskina, Svetlana V/0000-0001-6798-8082; Fasano, Matteo/0000-0002-3997-3681; Morciano, Matteo/0000-0002-4020-4521; Chiavazzo, Eliodoro/0000-0001-6165-7434",Compagnia di San Paolo; Italian National Project PRIN Heat transfer and Thermal Energy Storage Enhancement by Foams and Nanoparticles [2017F7KZWS],Compagnia di San Paolo(Compagnia di San Paolo); Italian National Project PRIN Heat transfer and Thermal Energy Storage Enhancement by Foams and Nanoparticles,"The authors thank Gang Chen for the useful discussions.

To sustain this growth trajectory, continued cost and capital expenditure (capex) reductions are needed. Thinning the silicon wafer well below the industry-standard 160 mu m, in principle reduces both manufacturing cost and capex, and accelerates economically-sustainable expansion of PV manufacturing. In this analysis piece, we explore two questions surrounding adoption of thin silicon wafers: (a) What are the market benefits of thin wafers? (b) What are the technological challenges to adopt thin wafers? In this analysis, we re-evaluate the benefits and challenges of thin Si for current and future PV modules using a comprehensive technoeconomic framework that couples device simulation, bottom-up cost modeling, and a sustainable cash-flow growth model. When adopting an advanced technology concept that features sufficiently good surface passivation, the comparable efficiencies are achievable for both 50 mu m wafers and 160 mu m ones. We then quantify the economic benefits for thin Si wafers in terms of poly-Si-to-module manufacturing capex, module cost, and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for utility PV systems. Particularly, LCOE favors thinner wafers for all investigated device architectures, and can potentially be reduced by more than 5% from the value of 160 mu m wafers. With further improvements in module efficiency, an advanced device concept with 50 mu m wafers could potentially reduce manufacturing capex by 48%, module cost by 28%, and LCOE by 24%. Furthermore, we apply a sustainable growth model to investigate PV deployment scenarios in 2030. It is found that the state-of-the-art industry concept could not achieve the climate targets even with very aggressive financial scenarios, therefore the capex reduction benefit of thin wafers is advantageous to facilitate faster PV adoption. Lastly, we discuss the remaining technological challenges and areas for innovation to enable high-yield manufacturing of high-efficiency PV modules with thin Si wafers.","[Liu, Zhe; Sofia, Sarah E.; Laine, Hannu S.; Wieghold, Sarah; Peters, Ian Marius; Buonassisi, Tonio] MIT, Dept Mech Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Woodhouse, Michael] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, Strateg Energy Anal Ctr, Golden, CO USA; [Laine, Hannu S.] Sellforte Inc, Helsinki, Finland; [Wieghold, Sarah] Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); United States Department of Energy (DOE); National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA; State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Liu, Z; Buonassisi, T (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Mech Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",zheliu@mit.edu; buonassisi@mit.edu,"Liu, Zhe/T-9004-2019; Peters, Marius/C-1322-2009","Liu, Zhe/0000-0001-7268-6214; Peters, Ian Marius/0000-0002-1725-0909; Wieghold, Sarah/0000-0001-6169-3961",U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) under Photovoltaic Research and Development (PVRD) program [DE-EE0007535]; TOTAL Energy Fellowship through the MIT Energy Initiative; DOE-NSF ERF for Quantum Energy and Sustainable Solar Technologies (QESST); Singapore's National Research Foundation through the Singapore MIT Alliance for Research and Technology's Low energy electronic systems (LEES) IRG'',"U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) under Photovoltaic Research and Development (PVRD) program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); TOTAL Energy Fellowship through the MIT Energy Initiative; DOE-NSF ERF for Quantum Energy and Sustainable Solar Technologies (QESST); Singapore's National Research Foundation through the Singapore MIT Alliance for Research and Technology's Low energy electronic systems (LEES) IRG''(Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research & Technology Centre (SMART)National Research Foundation, Singapore)","The authors thank Dr Qi Wang from Jinko Solar, Dr Yifeng Chen from Trina Solar, Dr Hongbin Fang from Longi Solar and Dr Shaffiq Jaffer from TOTAL to provide the industrial perspectives about the thin wafer manufacturing.

In both plants, natural gas turbines power the equipment. A net of only 10.8% of the CCU plant's CO2-equivalent (CO(2)e) emissions and 10.5% of the CO2 removed from the air by the SDACCU plant are captured over 20 years, and only 20-31%, are captured over 100 years. The low net capture rates are due to uncaptured combustion emissions from natural gas used to power the equipment, uncaptured upstream emissions, and, in the case of CCU, uncaptured coal combustion emissions. Moreover, the CCU and SDACCU plants both increase air pollution and total social costs relative to no capture. Using wind to power the equipment reduces CO(2)e relative to using natural gas but still allows air pollution emissions to continue and increases the total social cost relative to no carbon capture. Conversely, using wind to displace coal without capturing carbon reduces CO(2)e, air pollution, and total social cost substantially. In sum, CCU and SDACCU increase or hold constant air pollution health damage and reduce little carbon before even considering sequestration or use leakages of carbon back to the air. Spending on capture rather than wind replacing either fossil fuels or bioenergy always increases total social cost substantially. No improvement in CCU or SDACCU equipment can change this conclusion while fossil fuel emissions exist, since carbon capture always incurs an equipment cost never incurred by wind, and carbon capture never reduces, instead mostly increases, air pollution and fuel mining, which wind eliminates. Once fossil fuel emissions end, CCU (for industry) and SDACCU social costs need to be evaluated against the social costs of natural reforestation and reducing nonenergy halogen, nitrous oxide, methane, and biomass burning emissions.","[Jacobson, Mark Z.] Stanford Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Jacobson, MZ (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",jacobson@stanford.edu,,"Jacobson, Mark/0000-0002-4315-4128",,,,,14,43,44,8,79,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",1754-5692,1754-5706,,ENERG ENVIRON SCI,Energy Environ.

It is expected that it will continue to grow, as the world's population gets wealthier, social dynamics change and people demand more affordable and useful materials. The industry recognises that the Earth's carrying capacity is limited. It is adapting to seek to become a truly sustainable 'carbo'-chemical industry. This paper will address the three main challenges of this transition: shifting hydrocarbon stock, climate change and circular economy. As the energy sector transitions from oil, coal and eventually natural gas, it is expected that the chemical industry will have access to abundant hydrocarbon stocks for which it can find valuable uses. But rising CO2 prices and increasing upgrading costs will likely encourage greater use of alternative, low-carbon feedstocks. In particular, there may be a development of biomass for manufacturing oxygenated chemical intermediates and bio-based materials. To help tackle climate change, the industry will need to reduce the CO2 emissions of its processes and utilities (energy sources). Ways to achieve this will include efficiency improvements, electrification of utilities and processes and switching to renewable H-2; upgrading by-products to chemicals; and CO2 capture and storage or utilisation (CCS/CCU). The issue of plastic waste pollution is combining with the challenges discussed above to push society and governments towards a more circular economy. Customer demand for sustainable products is growing. New regulations (and technologies) are being rolled out for waste collection, sorting and recycling. In addition, the industry is making pledges to produce and use more sustainably. However, it is expected that fresh carbon will still have to enter the material cycle. It will be needed to feed the growth of the chemical industry and to compensate for inevitable recycling losses.

A key knowledge gap is the sustainable manufacturing capacity of existing and future commercial PV cell technologies imposed by scarce metals, and a suitable pathway towards sustainable manufacturing at the multi-TW scale. Assuming an upper material consumption limit as 20% of 2019 global supply, we show that the present industrial implementations of passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC), tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon), and silicon heterojunction (SHJ) cells have sustainable manufacturing capacities of 377 GW (silver-limited), 227 GW (silver-limited) GW and 37 GW (indium-limited), respectively. We propose material consumption targets of 2 mg W-1, 0.38 mg W-1, and 1.8 mg W-1 for silver, indium, and bismuth, respectively, indicating significant material consumption reductions are required to meet the target production rate for sustainable multi-TW scale manufacturing in about ten years from now. The industry needs urgent innovation on screen printing technologies for PERC, TOPCon, and SHJ solar cells to reduce silver consumption beyond expectation in the Industrial Technology Roadmap for PV (ITPRV), or the widespread adoption of existing and proven copper plating technologies. Indium cannot be used in any significant manufacturing capacity for PV production, even for futuristic 30%-efficient tandem devices. The current implementation of low-temperature interconnection schemes using bismuth-based solders will be limited to 330 GW of production. With half the silver-limited sustainable manufacturing capacity as PERC, the limited efficiency gains of SHJ and TOPCon cell technologies do not justify a transition away from industrial PERC, or the introduction of indium- and bismuth limitations for SHJ solar cells. On the other hand, futuristic two-terminal tandems with efficiency potentials over 30% have a unique opportunity to reduce material consumption through substantially reduced series resistance losses.","[Zhang, Yuchao; Kim, Moonyong; Li Wang; Verlinden, Pierre; Hallam, Brett] Univ New South Wales, Sch Photovolta & Renewable Energy Engn, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Verlinden, Pierre] AMROCK Australia Pty Ltd, POB 714, Mclaren Vale, SA 5171, Australia; [Verlinden, Pierre] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Inst Solar Energy Syst, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Verlinden, Pierre] Trina Solar, State Key Lab PVST, Changzhou, Peoples R China",University of New South Wales Sydney; Sun Yat Sen University; Trina Solar,"Zhang, YC (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Sch Photovolta & Renewable Energy Engn, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",Yuchao.Zhang@unsw.edu.au,"WANG, LI/AED-0400-2022","WANG, LI/0000-0003-1820-2316; Verlinden, Pierre/0000-0003-2473-0326; Zhang, Yuchao/0000-0002-0151-5781",Australian Government through the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA); Australian Center for Advanced Photovoltaics (ACAP),Australian Government through the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA)(Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA)); Australian Center for Advanced Photovoltaics (ACAP),"The authors would like to acknowledge Sophie Burrage who assisted with data collection and the discussion.

These natural resources have improved billions of lives, worldwide, in providing accessible, relatively inexpensive energy at nearly every scale. Notwithstanding the credible advances in renewable energy production over the past decade or so, the aerial combustion of coal, natural gas and liquid fossil fuels, given humankinds insatiable demand for power, will continue to be the ready source of more than 85% of the world's energy in the foreseeable and possibly the distant future. Human activities based on the combustion of fossil fuels, however, has led to significant anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere - and that fact is now seen as the major contributor to global warming and climate change. To stabilise global mean temperatures will depend on the ultimate transformation of humankind's energy system to one that does not introduce CO2 into the atmosphere. The hydrogen economy has long been mooted as a route to achieving the required net-zero emissions energy future. Paradoxically, fossil fuel sources such as petroleum, crude and extra-heavy crude oil, petrol, diesel and methane are reported here to produce high volumes of high-purity hydrogen through their microwave-initiated catalytic dehydrogenation using fine iron particles. The co-product of this dehydrogenation process, solid carbon, can be safely stored underground in perpetuity or converted in future to valuable hydrocarbons and other materials. Through their catalytic dehydrogenation to yield carbon-free hydrogen - rather than through their aerial combustion to produce carbon dioxide - petroleum and other fossil fuels can now serve as an energy pathway to stabilising global mean temperatures.","[Jie, Xiangyu; Gonzalez-Cortes, Sergio; Xiao, Tiancun; Yao, Benzhen; Fang, Yiwen; Miller, Noah; Dilworth, Jonathan R.; Edwards, Peter P.] Univ Oxford, KACST, Oxford Ctr Excellence Petrochem KOPRC, Inorgan Chem Lab,Dept Chem, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QR, England; [Wang, Jiale] Univ Oxford, Dept Mat, Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PH, England; [Slocombe, Daniel R.] Cardiff Univ, Sch Engn, Queens Buildings, Cardiff CF24 3AA, S Glam, Wales; [Al-Megren, Hamid A.] King Abdulaziz City Sci & Technol, Petrochem Res Inst, POB 6086, Riyadh 11442, Saudi Arabia; [Thomas, John M.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Mat Sci & Met, 27 Charles Babbage Rd, Cambridge CB3 0FS, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; Cardiff University; University of Cambridge,"Xiao, TC; Edwards, PP (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, KACST, Oxford Ctr Excellence Petrochem KOPRC, Inorgan Chem Lab,Dept Chem, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QR, England.;Thomas, JM (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Mat Sci & Met, 27 Charles Babbage Rd, Cambridge CB3 0FS, England.",xiao.tiancun@chem.ox.ac.uk; jmt2@cam.ac.uk; peter.edwards@chem.ox.ac.uk,"Slocombe, Daniel R/R-1114-2016; Gonzalez-Cortes, Sergio/M-2778-2019; Miller, Noah/AAE-3171-2021; GONZALEZ-CORTES, SERGIO/I-5447-2018","Slocombe, Daniel R/0000-0003-3590-6075; Gonzalez-Cortes, Sergio/0000-0003-3183-1686; GONZALEZ-CORTES, SERGIO/0000-0003-3183-1686; YAO, Benzhen/0000-0002-4117-0538; dilworth, jonathan/0000-0002-2863-0616; Fang, Yiwen/0000-0001-7939-0512; Miller, Noah/0000-0003-2912-2880; JIE, XIANGYU/0000-0003-0135-1040",KACST; EPSRC; China Scholarship Council,KACST; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),We thank KACST and EPSRC for continued financial support and Dr Afrah Aldawsari and Professor Adrian Porch for their expert assistance in this project.

Furthermore, fossil fuels are forecasted to remain the dominant source of energy in the near future. Therefore, capture and sequestration of greenhouse gases and in particular carbon dioxide is likely to be a major pathway toward environmental protection and energy sustainability. Such clarity has stimulated an intense and diverse range of research into various capture and mitigation technologies, which race with global warming in real-time. Quantification of the performance improvement rates of these technologies can inform decision-makers' long-term investment strategies, and help researchers to identify technical bottlenecks and research potential. The present research estimates the yearly performance improvement rate of CO2 capture, non-CO2 GHG capture, and GHG mitigation technologies, using a novel method based on patent data and the corresponding citation network. Our findings suggest that membrane-based, condensation/rectification-based, and adsorption-based carbon capture are the most promising technologies. Furthermore, the average CO2 capture technologies are likely to improve slightly faster than solar, wind, and battery technologies, indicating their important role in future electrical grids. Unfortunately, subterranean or submarine CO2 storage was identified as a slow-growing technological domain and potentially a bottleneck in the future sustainable carbon chain, which requires further efforts.","[Sharifzadeh, Mahdi; Triulzi, Giorgio; Magee, Christopher L.] MIT, Inst Data Syst & Soc, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Sharifzadeh, Mahdi] Sharif Univ Technol, Sharif Energy Res Inst, Tehran 1459777611, Iran; [Triulzi, Giorgio] Univ los Andes, Sch Management, Calle 21 1-20, Bogota, Colombia",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Sharif University of Technology; Universidad de los Andes (Colombia),"Sharifzadeh, M (corresponding author), MIT, Inst Data Syst & Soc, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;Sharifzadeh, M (corresponding author), Sharif Univ Technol, Sharif Energy Res Inst, Tehran 1459777611, Iran.",m.sharifzadeh@sharif.edu,Sharifzadeh/AAB-3027-2021,"Sharifzadeh, Mahdi/0000-0002-7895-5646; Magee, Christopher/0000-0001-5316-8358",SUTD-MIT International Design Center [6921538],SUTD-MIT International Design Center,"Prof. Christopher L.

Climate change threatens to exacerbate these through further disruption of the physical environment, and a transition away from the fossil fuels on which many of the region's economies depend. Through their nationally determined contributions (NDC) to the Paris Agreement, all SSA countries committed to the increased utilisation of intermittent renewable energy sources (IRES) to tackle the twin challenges of energy poverty-which limits economic development-and climate change. There is a dearth of analysis on the nature of sustainable energy transition(s) necessary to deliver these NDCs, especially given the limited financial and technical resources of SSA. Using Nigeria as a case study, this study seeks to address this gap by determining the power system transitions required to deliver NDCs alongside universal energy access in SSA by 2050; their financial and policy implications; and the barriers and opportunities that they present to sustainable development efforts. We find that Nigeria can deliver its NDCs with no added cost implications, thereby debunking the prevalent view that climate change mitigation is too costly to pursue in SSA. Furthermore, we find that the higher availability and dispatchability of fossil fuel generation makes it critical for the rapid scale-up of energy supply; thus, entirely leapfrogging carbon-intensive development will prove costly to SSA. Finally, owing to the limited cost reductions that IRES have experienced in SSA, delivering NDCs through the deployment of decentralised IRES systems proves more expensive than using conventional generation. The distributed nature of IRES however means that they can democratise energy investment and job creation, thus facilitating the equitable sharing of economic resources which is crucial to conflict prevention in the fragile socio-political landscapes that pervade the region.","[Daggash, Habiba Ahut] Imperial Coll London, Grantham Inst Climate Change & Environm, Exhibit Rd, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Daggash, Habiba Ahut; Mac Dowell, Niall] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Environm Policy, Exhibit Rd, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Daggash, Habiba Ahut; Mac Dowell, Niall] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Proc Syst Engn, Exhibit Rd, London SW7 2AZ, England",RLUK- Research Libraries UK; Imperial College London; RLUK- Research Libraries UK; Imperial College London; RLUK- Research Libraries UK; Imperial College London,"Daggash, HA (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Grantham Inst Climate Change & Environm, Exhibit Rd, London SW7 2AZ, England.;Daggash, HA (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Ctr Environm Policy, Exhibit Rd, London SW7 2AZ, England.;Daggash, HA (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Ctr Proc Syst Engn, Exhibit Rd, London SW7 2AZ, England.",h.daggash16@imperial.ac.uk,"Daggash, Habiba Ahut/R-7966-2017","Daggash, Habiba Ahut/0000-0002-7598-779X",Natural Environment Research Council Science and Solutions for a Changing Planet Doctoral Training Programme (SSCP DTP); NERC [NE/P019900/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Natural Environment Research Council Science and Solutions for a Changing Planet Doctoral Training Programme (SSCP DTP); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),We thank the Natural Environment Research Council Science and Solutions for a Changing Planet Doctoral Training Programme (SSCP DTP) for the funding of a PhD scholarship.,,79,5,5,2,11,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",1754-5692,1754-5706,,ENERG ENVIRON SCI,Energy Environ.

This study evaluates the economics, environmental impact, risk assessment, and optimal processing route of bio-SA production from multiple feedstocks (first, second, and third-generation), including (1) glucose, (2) corn stover, (3) glycerol, and (4) seaweed. A superstructure-based optimization model consisting of 39 processing alternatives with a technology readiness level of 7-9 is developed, and the optimal topology for bio-SA production by maximization of the net present value under deterministic and stochastic conditions is identified. Once optimization is completed, the framework provides clear guidance for multi-criteria analysis, including the technical, economical, and environmental aspects of the biorefinery. The results indicate that glycerol is the best feedstock and corn stover is the second to best, producing bio-SA at selling prices of 1.6-1.9 USD per kg and 1.7-2.0 USD per kg, respectively, through their optimal processing pathways. Saccharina japonica (seaweed) is less suitable for large-scale bio-SA production due to the high cost of seaweed and the inability of enzymes to hydrolyze alginate, which is one of the major carbohydrate fractions (25-30 wt%) of this feedstock. The environmental results indicate that the optimal pathway from glycerol is the most environmentally friendly process, followed by optimal processing pathways from substrates such as corn stover, glucose, and S. japonica.","[Dickson, Rofice; Mancini, Enrico; Garg, Nipun; Woodley, John M.; Gernaey, Krist V.; Pinelo, Manuel; Mansouri, Seyed Soheil] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Chem & Biochem Engn, Bldg 229, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Dickson, Rofice; Liu, Jay] Pukyong Natl Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Busan 48513, South Korea; [Dickson, Rofice] Lahore Univ Management Sci, Dept Chem & Chem Engn, SBA Sch Sci & Engn, Lahore 54792, Pakistan",Technical University of Denmark; Pukyong National University; Lahore University of Management Sciences,"Mansouri, SS (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Chem & Biochem Engn, Bldg 229, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.;Liu, J (corresponding author), Pukyong Natl Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Busan 48513, South Korea.",jayliu@pknu.ac.kr; seso@kt.dtu.dk,"Gernaey, Krist V./J-1759-2018; Liu, Jay/A-9538-2013; Mansouri, Seyed Soheil/AAE-6387-2021","Gernaey, Krist V./0000-0002-0364-1773; Liu, Jay/0000-0003-4274-2355; Mansouri, Seyed Soheil/0000-0002-0924-4947; Pinelo, Manuel/0000-0002-3944-6144; Mancini, Enrico/0000-0002-9833-3406; Woodley, John/0000-0002-7976-2483; Dickson, Rofice/0000-0003-0120-119X",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science and ICT [2019R1A2C2084709]; Sino-Danish Centre for Education and Research (SDC),National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science and ICT; Sino-Danish Centre for Education and Research (SDC),This research was supported through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grants funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (2019R1A2C2084709).

The distinctively designed ion gradient acts as an engine to accelerate ion migration by enhancing diffusion, hence increasing the generated current. Notably, the ion-engine HEG generates a record-breaking current density of 466.75 mu A cm(-2), 10 to 100 times higher than those of previously reported HEGs. The ion-engine HEG possesses the lowest internal resistance, which is the closest to that of commercial products. In addition, the high transparency, flexibility, and customisability of hydrogels offer HEGs a wide range of applications, such as night-time lighting, sweat monitoring, and powering small unmanned boats.

The NAEI bottom-up approach estimated 2019 methane (CH4) emissions from the extraction and transport of oil and natural gas (O&G) from offshore sources to onshore terminals at 52 Gg CH4, corresponding to the loss of 0.14% of gas production. Here we investigate the approaches used by the NAEI and find it substantially underestimates leakage. We suggest alternative integrated approaches that combine direct measurements, management practices, and the effects of environmental conditions to estimate fugitive emissions. We estimate the total UK CH4 emissions from flaring, combustion, processing, venting, and O&G transfer to be 289 Gg CH4 (0.72% of production), five times larger than the NAEI estimate. We suggest NAEI underestimates emissions because of outdated/incorrect emission factors, incomplete activity data, and incomplete data on vented emissions. Similarly, CH4 emissions from upstream O&G in other countries may be underestimated, with regional regulatory differences resulting in venting often being a substantially underestimated emission source. While bottom-up methods can be used to understand the relative size of emissions from the extraction and transport of O&G, they are inherently biased low as they only include emissions from processes and activities designated as emission sources and for which emission factors exist. Emission factors remain a large source of uncertainty as many used to generate the NAEI inventory are taken from industrial studies or unpublished research that have not been independently validated. To improve the NAEI estimate, widespread and frequent direct measurements are needed to supplement and improve bottom-up emission estimates generated with existing emission factors and activity levels.","[Riddick, Stuart N.

Whilst several CDR pathways have been identified, they vary significantly in terms of CO2 removal efficiency, elapsed time between their deployment and effective CO2 removal, and CO2 removal permanence. All these criteria are critical for the commercial-scale deployment of CDR. In this study, we evaluate a set of archetypal CDR pathways-including afforestation/reforestation (AR), bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), biochar, direct air capture of CO2 with storage (DACCS) and enhanced weathering (EW)-through this lens. We present a series of thought experiments, considering different climates and forest types for AR, land types, e.g. impacting biomass yield and (direct and indirect) land use change, and biomass types for BECCS and biochar, capture processes for DACCS, and rock types for EW. Results show that AR can be highly efficient in delivering CDR, up to 95-99% under optimal conditions. However, regional bio-geophysical factors, such as the near-term relatively slow and limited forest growth in cold climates, or the long-term exposure to natural disturbances, e.g. wildfires in warm and dry climates, substantially reduces the overall CO2 removal efficiency of AR. Conversely, BECCS delivers immediate and permanent CDR, but its CO2 removal efficiency can be significantly impacted by any initial carbon debt associated with (direct and indirect) land use change, and thereby significantly delayed. Biochar achieves low CDR efficiency, in the range of 20-39% when it is first integrated with the soil, and that regardless of the biomass feedstock considered. Moreover, its CO2 removal efficiency can decrease to -3 to 5% with time, owing to the decay of biochar. Finally, as for BECCS, DACCS and EW deliver permanent CO2 removal, but their CO2 removal efficiencies are substantially characterized by the energy system within which they are deployed, in the range of -5 to 90% and 17-92%, respectively, if currently deployed. However, the CDR efficiency of EW can increase to 51-92% with time, owing to the carbonation rate of EW.","[Chiquier, Solene; Patrizio, Piera; Bui, Mai; Sunny, Nixon; Mac Dowell, Niall] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Environm Policy, London, England; [Chiquier, Solene; Patrizio, Piera; Bui, Mai; Sunny, Nixon; Mac Dowell, Niall] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Proc Syst Engn, London, England",Imperial College London; Imperial College London,"Mac Dowell, N (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Ctr Environm Policy, London, England.;Mac Dowell, N (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Ctr Proc Syst Engn, London, England.",niall@imperial.ac.uk,,"Bui, Mai/0000-0002-2658-250X; Chiquier, Solene/0000-0002-2730-574X","European Union [869192]; CO2RE Hub - Natural Environment Research Council [NE/V013106/1]; Research Councils UK (RCUK) [NE/P019900/1, EP/T033940/1]; European Commission [271498, 691712]",European Union(European Commission); CO2RE Hub - Natural Environment Research Council; Research Councils UK (RCUK)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)); European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre),"S.

However, given the vast energy required to activate the CO2 molecule, CCU may have implications on sustainable development that are still poorly understood due to the narrow scope of current carbon footprint-oriented assessments lacking absolute sustainability thresholds. To bridge this gap, we developed a power-chemicals nexus model to look into the future and understand how we could produce 22 net-zero bulk chemicals of crucial importance in a sustainable manner by integrating fossil, CCU routes and power technologies, often assessed separately. We evaluated the environmental performance of these technologies in terms of their contribution to 5 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), using 16 life cycle assessment metrics and 9 planetary boundaries (PB) to quantify and interpret the impact values. We found that fossil chemicals could hamper the attainment of SDG 3 on good health and well-being and SDG 13 on climate change. CCU could help meet SDG 13 but would damage other SDGs due to burden-shifting to human health, water scarcity, and minerals and metals depletion impacts. The collateral damage could be mitigated by judiciously combining fossil and CCU routes with carbon-negative power sources guided by optimisation models incorporating SDGs-based performance criteria explicitly. Our work highlights the importance of embracing the SDGs in technology development to sensibly support the low-carbon energy and chemicals transition.","[Ioannou, Iasonas; Perez-Ramirez, Javier; Guillen-Gosalbez, Gonzalo] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Chem & Appl Biosci, Inst Chem & Bioengn, Vladimir Prelog Weg 1, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Galan-Martin, Angel] Univ Jaen, Dept Chem Environm & Mat Engn, Campus Las Lagunillas S-N, Jaen 23071, Spain; [Galan-Martin, Angel] Univ Jaen, Ctr Adv Studies Earth Sci Energy & Environm, Campus Las Lagunillas S-N, Jaen 23071, Spain",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Universidad de Jaen; Universidad de Jaen,"Perez-Ramirez, J; Guillen-Gosalbez, G (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Chem & Appl Biosci, Inst Chem & Bioengn, Vladimir Prelog Weg 1, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",jpr@chem.ethz.ch; gonzalo.guillen.gosalbez@chem.ethz.ch,"Guillén-Gosálbez, Gonzalo/G-3531-2016","Guillén-Gosálbez, Gonzalo/0000-0001-6074-8473; Perez-Ramirez, Javier/0000-0002-5805-7355","NCCR Catalysis [180544]; Swiss National Science Foundation; Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation, and Universities [BG20/00074]","NCCR Catalysis; Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation, and Universities(Spanish Government)","This publication was created as part of NCCR Catalysis (grant 180544), a National Centre of Competence in Research funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation.

Residual biomass is a valuable resource, that can replace greenhouse gas intensive fossil fuels. This study assesses large-scale scenarios for utilizing crop and forestry residues, animal manure, food waste, and sewage sludge from a system perspective, and simulates impacts to interrelated electricity and heating systems. The scenarios cover production of biofuels, electricity and heat, as well as materials and feed. Dynamic energy prices and marginal emissions are based on modeling the Chinese energy system towards 2035 in a partial equilibrium linear optimization model, optimizing investments and operation as well as electricity trade and transmission between regions. The resulting marginal emissions and system costs quantify impacts specific to the modeled Chinese energy system in 2035. Scenario costs are assessed including monetization of environmental impacts which were addressed based on a life cycle approach to reflect impacts on global warming, air pollution, marine- and freshwater eutrophication. The study finds that there are major benefits to utilizing residual biomass in all impact categories. Nitrogen leaching was found to pose the largest economic impact. The study furthermore shows that when comparing the climate impact of biomass use scenarios, it is important to include biogenic carbon as well as case-specific marginal emissions.","[Shapiro-Bengtsen, Sara; Munster, Marie] Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Technol Management & Econ, Produktionstorvet Bygning 424, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Hamelin, Lorie] Fed Univ Toulouse, Toulouse Biotechnol Inst TBI, INSA, INRAE,CNRS, 135 Ave Rangueil, F-31077 Toulouse 4, France; [Bregnbaek, Lars] Ea Energy Anal, Gammeltory 8, DK-1457 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Zou, Lele] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Sci & Dev, 15 Zhong Guan Cun Bei Yi Tiao Alley, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China",Technical University of Denmark; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); INRAE; Chinese Academy of Sciences,"Shapiro-Bengtsen, S (corresponding author), Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Technol Management & Econ, Produktionstorvet Bygning 424, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark.",sajos@dtu.dk,"Münster, Marie/K-9249-2017; Hamelin, Lorie/I-2280-2018","Münster, Marie/0000-0002-5543-547X; Shapiro-Bengtsen, Sara/0000-0003-0644-4377; Hamelin, Lorie/0000-0001-9092-1900",Sino-Danish Centre for Education and Research - French National Research Agency [ANR-17-MGPA-0006]; Region Occitanie [18015981],Sino-Danish Centre for Education and Research - French National Research Agency; Region Occitanie(Region Occitanie),"The authors would like to thank Gregor Shapiro for his diligent proofreading of the article, the reviewers for their constructive feedback, and Hui Jingxuan, Energy Research Institute of Academy of Macroeconomic Research/NDRC, for her valuable contribution.

A promising process is temperature vacuum swing adsorption (TVSA) employing amine functionalised adsorbents such as Lewatit (R) VP OC 1065, which is selected as a benchmark sorbent in this study. To further improve process design, and critically lower costs, detailed modelling of DAC cycles is imperative. However, the multi-component adsorption on these materials, particularly the cooperative adsorption of CO2 and H2O, is crudely understood, and yet to be described in mathematical terms, prohibiting sound modelling efforts. Here, we commit in-depth understanding of the effect of humidity on CO2 adsorption and demonstrate how this impacts modelling of DAC cycles. We present two novel mechanistic co-adsorption isotherm models to describe water's effect on CO2 adsorption and find a good fit to original experimental co-adsorption data. We also show the considerable improvement in predictions of these models when compared to an empirical co-adsorption isotherm model from literature. A detailed TVSA DAC cycle process model is then used elucidating how different co-adsorption models affect the predicted process performance. It is found that the two novel isotherm models generate similar results and Pareto fronts, whilst the minimum work equivalent calculated using the more conservative of the two models is found to be 2.49 MJ kg(-1) for the case study considered. These mathematical descriptions laid out will lead to more accurate modelling and optimisation of cyclic DAC adsorption processes, prompting a greater understanding of the material-process combinations ideal for DAC and how costs can be driven down in the years to come. Importantly, they allowed us to independently benchmark a Climeworks type DAC process, providing key DAC performance data to the public domain.","[Young, John; Garcia-Diez, Enrique; Garcia, Susana; van der Spek, Mijndert] Heriot Watt Univ, Res Ctr Carbon Solut, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland",Heriot Watt University,"Young, J; van der Spek, M (corresponding author), Heriot Watt Univ, Res Ctr Carbon Solut, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland.",jpy1@hw.ac.uk; m.van_der_spek@hw.ac.uk,,"Garcia, Susana/0000-0002-3713-311X; Young, John/0000-0002-7409-0702; Van der Spek, Mijndert/0000-0002-3365-2289","PrISMa Project through the ACT Programme (Accelerating CCS Technologies, Horizon 2020 Project [299659, 294766]; Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS); NERC; EPSRC Research Councils, United Kingdom; Research Council of Norway (RCN); Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE); U.S. Department of Energy; TOTAL; Equinor","PrISMa Project through the ACT Programme (Accelerating CCS Technologies, Horizon 2020 Project; Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); EPSRC Research Councils, United Kingdom(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Research Council of Norway (RCN)(Research Council of Norway); Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE); U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); TOTAL(Total SA); Equinor","T The research in this article was supported in part by the PrISMa Project (299659), funded through the ACT Programme (Accelerating CCS Technologies, Horizon 2020 Project 294766).

Emission reductions by Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) depend strongly on the choice of the CO(2)source because CO(2)sources differ in CO(2)concentration and the resulting energy demand for capture. From a climate-change perspective, CO(2)should be captured at the CO(2)source with the lowest CO(2)emissions from capture. However, reported carbon footprints differ widely for CO(2)captured, from strongly negative to strongly positive for the same source. The differences are due to methodological ambiguity in the treatment of multifunctionality in current assessment practice. This paper reviews methodological approaches for determining the carbon footprint of captured CO(2)as carbon feedstock, and shows why some approaches lead to suboptimal choices of CO(2)sources and that increased consistency in life cycle assessment (LCA) studies on CCU is needed. Based on strict application of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) standards and guidelines, it is shown that substitution should be applied to avoid suboptimal choices of CO(2)sources. The resulting methodological recommendations are applied to estimate the carbon footprint of feedstock CO(2)for current CO(2)sources in Europe and for future CO(2)sources in a scenario for a low carbon economy. For all CO(2)sources, the cradle-to-gate footprint of captured CO(2)is negative ranging from -0.95 to -0.59 kg CO(2)eq. per kg of feedstock CO(2)today and from -0.99 to -0.98 kg CO(2)eq. in a low carbon economy. The carbon footprints of different CO(2)sources differ mainly due to their energy demands. The presented assessment method and the carbon footprints of the CO(2)feedstocks CO(2)provide the basis for future assessments of carbon capture and utilization processes.","[Mueller, Leonard Jan; Kaetelhoen, Arne; von der Assen, Niklas; Bardow, Andre] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Tech Thermodynam, Schinkelstr 8, D-52062 Aachen, Germany; [Kaetelhoen, Arne] Carbon Minds GmbH, Eupener Str 165, D-50933 Cologne, Germany; [Bringezu, Stefan; Kaiser, Simon] Univ Kassel, Ctr Environm Syst Res CESR, Wilhelmshoher Allee 47, D-34109 Kassel, Germany; [McCoy, Sean] Univ Calgary, Dept Chem & Petr Engn, 750 Campus Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 4H9, Canada; [Suh, Sangwon] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Bren Hall,2400 Univ Calif, Santa Barbara, CA 93117 USA; [Edwards, Robert] European Commiss Joint Res Ctr, Via Enrico Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy; [Sick, Volker] Univ Michigan, Dept Mech Engn, 2007 WE Lay Automot Lab,1231 Beal Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Cuellar-Franca, Rosa] Univ Manchester, Dept Chem Engn & Analyt Sci, Sackville St, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [El Khamlichi, Aicha] Ademe Ind, Dept Ave Gresille,BP 90406, F-49004 Angers 01, France; [Lee, Jay H.] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, 291 Daehak Ro,373-1 Guseong, Daejeon 305338, South Korea; [Bardow, Andre] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res Energy Syst Engn IEK 10, Julich, Germany; [Bardow, Andre] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Mech & Proc Engn, Energy & Proc Syst Engn, Zurich, Switzerland",RWTH Aachen University; Universitat Kassel; University of Calgary; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; N8 Research Partnership; University of Manchester; Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST); Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Bardow, A (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Tech Thermodynam, Schinkelstr 8, D-52062 Aachen, Germany.;Bardow, A (corresponding author), Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res Energy Syst Engn IEK 10, Julich, Germany.;Bardow, A (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Mech & Proc Engn, Energy & Proc Syst Engn, Zurich, Switzerland.",abardow@ethz.ch,"Bardow, André/C-5446-2009; Lee, Jay Hyung/C-1808-2011; McCoy, Sean Thomas/AAC-9470-2022; Sick, Volker/AAG-2931-2021; von der Assen, Niklas/V-6288-2019","Bardow, André/0000-0002-3831-0691; Lee, Jay Hyung/0000-0001-6134-6118; McCoy, Sean Thomas/0000-0003-0401-893X; Sick, Volker/0000-0001-5756-9714; von der Assen, Niklas/0000-0001-8855-9420; Muller, Leonard/0000-0002-3155-6920",Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany in the project Dream Resource [033RC002]; Global CO2 Initiative; Canada First Research Excellence Fund (CFREF); BMBF project CO2-WIN-Connect [033RC016B],Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany in the project Dream Resource; Global CO2 Initiative; Canada First Research Excellence Fund (CFREF); BMBF project CO2-WIN-Connect(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"This research has been funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany in the project Dream Resource (033RC002).

Roadmaps are developed and grid analyses are performed here for 145 countries to address these problems. The roadmaps call for a 100% transition of all-purpose business-as-usual (BAU) energy to wind-water-solar (WWS) energy, efficiency, and storage, ideally by 2035, but by no later than 2050, with at least 80% by 2030. Grid stability analyses find that the countries, grouped into 24 regions, can exactly match demand with 100% WWS supply and storage, from 2050-2052. Worldwide, WWS reduces end-use energy by 56.4%, private annual energy costs by 62.7% (from $17.8 to $6.6 trillion per year), and social (private plus health plus climate) annual energy costs by 92.0% (from $83.2 to $6.6 trillion per year) at a present-value cost of similar to$61.5 trillion. The mean payback times of the capital cost due to energy- and social-cost savings are 5.5 and 0.8 years, respectively. WWS is estimated to create 28.4 million more long-term, full-time jobs than lost worldwide and may need only similar to 0.17% and similar to 0.36% of world land for new footprint and spacing, respectively. Thus, WWS requires less energy, costs less, and creates more jobs than BAU. Sensitivity test indicate the following. Increasing district heating and cooling may reduce costs by allowing flexible loads to replace inflexible loads, thereby replacing electricity storage and overgeneration with low-cost heat storage. A battery cost that is 50% higher than in the base case increases mean overall energy costs by only 3.2 (0.03-14.5)%. Almost all regions need fewer hours of load shifting than assumed in the base case, suggesting that actual load shifting may be easier than assumed. Increasing the use of electricity for hydrogen fuel-cell-electric vehicles instead of for battery-electric vehicles increases overall cost in most regions tested, due to the greater efficiency of battery-electric vehicles, but decreases overall cost in some regions by improving grid stability. Finally, shifting battery vehicle charging from day-night to mostly day charging reduces cost in the regions tested; shifting to mostly night charging increases cost. Ninety-five percent of the technologies needed to implement the plans proposed are already commercial.","[Jacobson, Mark Z.; von Krauland, Anna-Katharina; Coughlin, Stephen J.; Dukas, Emily; Nelson, Alexander J.

Understanding the intricate physical and chemical processes across multiple length-scales is critical to assist the strategic design of electrodes for improved rate performance. Here, we correlate the discharge rate performance of Ni-rich LiNi1-x-yCoxMnyO2 (NMC) cathodes to the electrode architectures, ranging from the crystallographic orientations, surface morphology and cracks at single particle level, to the factors that affect the dominance of the solid and liquid-state transport (SST and LST) at electrode level. A random orientation of the primary particles is found to incur an increase of the SST resistance by a factor of 2.35 at 5C and a heterogeneous intra-particle lithiation. Internal cracks significantly restrict the accessibility to the active material. Double-layered particles are proved to be a more promising candidate than single-crystal particles. At electrode level, the SST-dominance depth is quantified for the first time to guide the microstructural tuning and rational operating windows are proposed for electrodes of various architectures. The reaction front is observed to shuttle across the electrode depth to mitigate the polarization, which can provide valuable insights into the battery management development. Finally, by comparing the performance of single crystal and polycrystalline NMC811 electrodes, it is suggested that electrode thickness and porosity are more critical in the former for enhanced discharge rate performance, in contrast to polycrystalline electrodes, in which a gradient particle fraction and size distribution are recommended.","[Lu, Xuekun; Tan, Chun; Heenan, Thomas M.

Among the global efforts to address the root causes of carbon emissions, numerous emerging technologies have been proposed to accelerate sustainable development for achieving carbon neutrality. While science-based discovery for emerging technologies, such as the development of novel materials, may help enhance sustainable development, analyzing the system design and economic viability is imperative for assessing the feasibility of the technology for upscaling and successful commercialization. Herein, we demonstrate the crucial importance of process modeling and techno-economic analysis by evaluating three emerging technologies at the water-energy nexus: direct seawater electrolysis, salinity gradient energy harvesting, and membrane-based thermal desalination. We show that the synergistic combination of techno-economic analysis and process modeling can effectively assess the potential feasibility of the emerging technologies at the early development stage. We further discuss the challenges of the three emerging technologies in their current states, indicating that they are not economically viable compared to the existing state-of-art technologies.

DMM production from hydrogen (H-2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) is technically feasible with established technology but results in a low overall process efficiency. Recent research in catalyst development has increased DMM yield significantly and new reaction pathways have been proposed. Yet, it remains unknown how the achievements in catalyst development affect process performance. To close this gap, we analyze processes based on five reaction pathways regarding exergy efficiency, production cost, and climate impact. As the pathways have different technology readiness levels, we develop a methodology that ensures consistent boundary conditions and model detail between pathways. The methodology enables a hierarchical optimization-based process design and evaluation. The results show that the non-oxidative (i.e., reductive, dehydrogenative, and transfer-hydrogenative) pathways consume stoichiometrically less H-2 not only than the established and oxidative pathway, but also less than most other electricity-based fuels (e-fuels). The higher resource efficiency of these pathways increases process exergy efficiency from 75% to 84%; production cost (2.1$ L-diesel-eq.(-1)) becomes competitive to other e-fuels; and the impact on climate change reduces by up to 92% compared to fossil diesel, if renewable electricity is utilized. Whereas the reductive pathway may already enable a sustainable production of DMM with only little catalyst improvements, the dehydrogenative and transfer-hydrogenative pathways still require a higher DMM selectivity and methanol conversion, respectively. With considerable catalyst improvements, a maximum exergy efficiency of 92% and minimum production cost of 2.0$ L-diesel-eq.(-1) are achievable. Our analyses show: With the non-oxidative pathways, the high potential of DMM is no longer restricted to its outstanding combustion characteristics but extended to its production.","[Burre, Jannik; Bongartz, Dominik; Mitsos, Alexander] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Proc Syst Engn AVT SVT, Forckenbeckstr 51, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; [Deutz, Sarah; Voelker, Simon; Bardow, Andre] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Tech Thermodynam, Schinkelstr 8, D-52062 Aachen, Germany; [Mebrahtu, Chalachew; Osterthun, Ole; Sun, Ruiyan; Klankermayer, Jurgen; Palkovits, Regina] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Tech & Macromol Chem, Worringerweg 1, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; [Bardow, Andre; Mitsos, Alexander] JARA ENERGY, Templergraben 55, D-52056 Aachen, Germany; [Bardow, Andre; Mitsos, Alexander] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res Energy Syst Engn IEK 10, Wilhelm Johnen Str, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Bardow, Andre] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Mech & Proc Engn, Tannenstr 3, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",RWTH Aachen University; RWTH Aachen University; RWTH Aachen University; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Mitsos, A (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Proc Syst Engn AVT SVT, Forckenbeckstr 51, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.;Mitsos, A (corresponding author), JARA ENERGY, Templergraben 55, D-52056 Aachen, Germany.;Mitsos, A (corresponding author), Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res Energy Syst Engn IEK 10, Wilhelm Johnen Str, D-52425 Julich, Germany.",amitsos@alum.mit.edu,"Bardow, André/C-5446-2009; Asmelash, Chalachew Mebrahtu/AAA-4750-2022; Osterthun, Ole/AAT-1902-2021; Sun, Ruiyan/AFP-5677-2022; Palkovits, Regina/G-2207-2014; Klankermayer, Jurgen/J-5697-2014","Bardow, André/0000-0002-3831-0691; Asmelash, Chalachew Mebrahtu/0000-0001-6122-0937; Osterthun, Ole/0000-0002-9324-6864; Sun, Ruiyan/0000-0002-1375-195X; Bongartz, Dominik/0000-0003-1790-0235; Deutz, Sarah/0000-0002-8062-7684; Palkovits, Regina/0000-0002-4970-2957; Klankermayer, Jurgen/0000-0003-2143-9402; Voelker, Simon/0000-0001-8579-6893; Burre, Jannik/0000-0003-1578-1869","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the Kopernikus Project P2X: Flexible use of renewable resources - exploration, validation and implementation of Power-to-X concepts [FKZ 03SFK2A]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the project NAMOSYN: Nachhaltige Mobilitat durch synthetische Kraftstoffe [FKZ 03SF0566P0]; Deutsche Forschungsgesellschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany's Excellence Strategy - Cluster of Excellence 2186 The Fuel Science Center [390919832]","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the Kopernikus Project P2X: Flexible use of renewable resources - exploration, validation and implementation of Power-to-X concepts(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the project NAMOSYN: Nachhaltige Mobilitat durch synthetische Kraftstoffe(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Deutsche Forschungsgesellschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany's Excellence Strategy - Cluster of Excellence 2186 The Fuel Science Center(German Research Foundation (DFG))","The authors gratefully acknowledge funding by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the Kopernikus Project P2X: Flexible use of renewable resources - exploration, validation and implementation of Power-to-X concepts (FKZ 03SFK2A) and the project NAMOSYN: Nachhaltige Mobilitat durch synthetische Kraftstoffe (FKZ 03SF0566P0).

CaCO3 is reacted with an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution by mixing under atmospheric temperatures and pressures. The reaction products are calcium hydroxide (hydrated lime; Ca(OH)(2)) and sodium carbonate (soda ash; Na2CO3). For the first time, the extent of this reaction at ambient conditions is studied along with the NaOH requirements. Conceptual process designs, which include procedures to separate and recover material, as well as energy calculations, are also presented to demonstrate the technical/industrial feasibility of the process. The technology is also successfully tested on industrially sourced limestone chalk, and the silica impurity remains inert throughout the process.

This activity (6 h) translates into a sustained Joule (sunlight) to Joule (fuel) photoconversion efficiency of 1%, with an apparent quantum efficiency of j = 86%. The timedependent photoconversion efficiency over 0.5 h intervals yields a maximum value of 3.3% (j = 92%). Isotopic tracer experiments confirm the hydrocarbon products originate from CO2 and water.","[Sorcar, Saurav; Hwang, Yunju; Lee, Jaewoong; Kim, Hwapyong; Grimes, Keltin M.; Grimes, Craig A.; In, Su-Il] DGIST, Dept Energy Sci & Engn, 333 Techno Jungang Daero, Daegu 42988, South Korea; [Jung, Jin-Woo; Cho, Chang-Hee] DGIST, Dept Emerging Mat Sci, 333 Techno Jungang Daero, Daegu 42988, South Korea; [Majima, Tetsuro] Osaka Univ, Inst Sci & Ind Res SANKEN, Mihogaoka 8-1, Ibaraki, Osaka 5670047, Japan; [Hoffmann, Michael R.] CALTECH, Linde Robinson Labs, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA",Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science & Technology (DGIST); Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science & Technology (DGIST); Osaka University; California Institute of Technology,"In, SI (corresponding author), DGIST, Dept Energy Sci & Engn, 333 Techno Jungang Daero, Daegu 42988, South Korea.",insuil@dgist.ac.kr,"Sorcar, Saurav/J-2336-2019; Kim, Hwapyong/E-3465-2019","Sorcar, Saurav/0000-0001-9154-836X; Cho, Chang-Hee/0000-0003-0014-5464; Kim, Hwapyong/0000-0002-9409-8218; Grimes, Keltin/0000-0002-2325-2134","Ministry of Science and ICT [2017R1E1A1A01074890, 2017M2A2A6A01070912]; Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes of the National Research Foundation (NRF) - Ministry of Science and ICT [2015M1A2A2074670]; Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea - Ministry of Science and ICT of the Korean Government [2016R1A2B4014448]","Ministry of Science and ICT(Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea); Technology Development Program to Solve Climate Changes of the National Research Foundation (NRF) - Ministry of Science and ICT(National Research Foundation of KoreaMinistry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea); Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea - Ministry of Science and ICT of the Korean Government(National Research Foundation of Korea)",The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the Ministry of Science and ICT (2017R1E1A1A01074890 & 2017M2A2A6A01070912).

A major question is whether the approach of coupling photovoltaics via the electricity grid to electrolysis is preferential to higher levels of device integration in 'artificial leaf' designs. Here, we scrutinise the effects of thermally coupled solar water splitting on device efficiencies and catalyst footprint for sub-freezing ambient temperatures of -20 degrees C. These conditions are found for a significant fraction of the year in many world regions. Using a combination of electrochemical experiments and modelling, we demonstrate that thermal coupling broadens the operating window and significantly reduces the required catalyst loading when compared to electrolysis decoupled from photovoltaics. Efficiency benefits differ qualitatively for dual- and triple-junction solar absorbers, which has implications for the general design of outdoor-located photoelectochemical devices. Similar to high-efficiency photovoltaics that reached technological maturity in space, application cases in polar or alpine climates could support the scale-up of solar hydrogen at the global scale.","[Koelbach, Moritz] Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin Mat & Energie GmbH, Inst Solar Fuels, Hahn Meitner Pl 1, D-14109 Berlin, Germany; [Koelbach, Moritz; May, Matthias M.] Univ Ulm, Inst Theoret Chem, Lise Meitner Str 16, D-89069 Ulm, Germany; [Rehfeld, Kira] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Environm Phys, INF 229, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum fuer Materialien und Energie GmbH (HZB); Ulm University; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"May, MM (corresponding author), Univ Ulm, Inst Theoret Chem, Lise Meitner Str 16, D-89069 Ulm, Germany.",matthias.may@uni-ulm.de,"Kölbach, Moritz/AAZ-4806-2021; May, Matthias/H-8552-2013; Rehfeld, Kira/O-1781-2019","May, Matthias/0000-0002-1252-806X; Rehfeld, Kira/0000-0002-9442-5362; Kolbach, Moritz/0000-0003-1828-0437","Volkswagen Foundation Experiment! grant; German Research Foundation [395588486, 434023472]",Volkswagen Foundation Experiment! grant; German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We thank Fatwa F.

However, low- and lower-middle income countries (LLMICs) have rapid population growth and a large potential for economic and industrial development. As a result, demand for energy will soar in LLMICs over the coming decades. Here, we consider how local manufacturing of photovoltaics can be an affordable pathway to a clean, sustainable and reliable energy supply for LLMICs. Local manufacturing could be cheaper, generate jobs and provide a stable local market for natural resources. Perovskite solar cells are particularly promising as they are compatible with low-tech processing techniques, making smaller scale manufacturing capacity economically viable. Our findings suggest local manufacturing is economically competitive to importing silicon modules in up to 71 out of 80 LLMICs analysed. Our Case Study of Ethiopia finds that the technological knowledge, raw materials and legislation required for local manufacturing are all present. A cost reduction of similar to 10% compared to GW-scale silicon production is sufficient to make local manufacturing economically viable.","[Roose, Bart; Allen, Lara; Stranks, Samuel D.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem Engn & Biotechnol, Philippa Fawcett Dr, Cambridge CB3 0AS, England; [Tennyson, Elizabeth M.; Stranks, Samuel D.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Phys, Cavendish Lab, 19 JJ Thomson Ave, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England; [Tennyson, Elizabeth M.; Allen, Lara] Ctr Global Equal, 8C Kings Parade, Cambridge CB2 1SJ, England; [Meheretu, Getnet] Bahir Dar Univ, Bahir Dar Energy Ctr, Bahir Dar Inst Technol, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia; [Meheretu, Getnet] Bahir Dar Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Phys, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia; [Kassaw, Amare] Bahir Dar Univ, Fac Elect & Comp Engn, Bahir Dar Inst Technol, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia; [Tilahun, Seifu A.] Bahir Dar Univ, Fac Civil & Water Resources Engn, Bahir Dar Inst Technol, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia",RLUK- Research Libraries UK; University of Cambridge; RLUK- Research Libraries UK; University of Cambridge; Bahir Dar University; Bahir Dar University; Bahir Dar University; Bahir Dar University,"Roose, B; Stranks, SD (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem Engn & Biotechnol, Philippa Fawcett Dr, Cambridge CB3 0AS, England.;Stranks, SD (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Phys, Cavendish Lab, 19 JJ Thomson Ave, Cambridge CB3 0HE, England.",br340@cam.ac.uk; sds65@cam.ac.uk,"Tennyson, Beth/HGA-3750-2022; Tennyson, Elizabeth/D-6472-2017","/0000-0002-8303-7292; Tilahun, Seifu/0000-0002-5219-4527; Roose, Bart/0000-0002-0972-1475; Tennyson, Elizabeth/0000-0003-0071-8445","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/T02030X/1, EP/R023980/1]; Tata Group [UF150033]; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skodowska-Curie grant [841265]",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Tata Group; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skodowska-Curie grant,"The authors acknowledge the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC, Grant Numbers EP/T02030X/1 and EP/R023980/1).

However, an ideal uranium sorbent combining the features of high capacity, excellent selectivity, and ultra-fast kinetics is highly desirable but a long-standing challenge due to the lack of a proper adsorbent. Herein, we adopted a prototypal hybridization strategy to design a rare ionic macroporous metal-organic framework (MOF) decorated with multiple functional groups. The resulting ionic adsorbent captures 99.98% of the uranium in just 120 min (from similar to 50 000 to similar to 10 ppb) and offers a very large distribution coefficient, KUd > 10(7) mL g(-1), demonstrating a strong affinity towards uranium. Notably, the material harvests 96.3% of uranium simply in 120 min from natural seawater, affording a remarkable enrichment index of 25044 and thereby introducing a new benchmark uranium adsorbent. Moreover, it satisfied the preset target of the UES standard (6 mg g(-1)) within 2 days and achieved a record uranium uptake capacity of 28.2 mg g(-1) from natural seawater only in 25 days, which is a significant breakthrough in UES. The structural evidence from both experimental and theoretical studies confirmed that the formation of favourable chelating motifs into the ionic macropores governs the highly selective recovery of uranium from water.","[Mollick, Samraj; Saurabh, Satyam; More, Yogeshwar D.; Fajal, Sahel; Ghosh, Sujit K.] Indian Inst Sci Educ & Res IISER, Dept Chem, Dr Homi Bhabha Rd, Pune 411008, Maharashtra, India; [Shirolkar, Mandar M.] Symbiosis Int Deemed Univ SIU, Symbiosis Ctr Nanosci & Nanotechnol SCNN, Pune 412115, Maharashtra, India; [Ghosh, Sujit K.] IISER, Ctr Water Res CWR, Pune, Maharashtra, India",Indian Institute of Science Education & Research (IISER) Pune; Symbiosis International University; Indian Institute of Science Education & Research (IISER) Pune,"Ghosh, SK (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci Educ & Res IISER, Dept Chem, Dr Homi Bhabha Rd, Pune 411008, Maharashtra, India.;Ghosh, SK (corresponding author), IISER, Ctr Water Res CWR, Pune, Maharashtra, India.",sghosh@iiserpune.ac.in,,"More, Yogeshwar/0000-0002-0968-0220",U.G.C.; DST-Inspire fellowship [DST/INSPIRE/03/2016/001694]; IISER-Pune; SERB [CRG/2019/000906],"U.G.C.(University Grants Commission, India); DST-Inspire fellowship; IISER-Pune; SERB(Department of Science & Technology (India)Science Engineering Research Board (SERB), India)",S.

We assess demand for fundamental resources until the year 2100, which are necessary independently from the specific nature of the used PV technology, i.e. energy, float-glass, and capital investments, and addtionally silver. Without technological learning serious resource constraints will arise. On the other hand, continued technological learning at current rates would be sufficient to stay within reasonable boundaries. With such technological learning, energy demand for production will correspond to 2-5% of global energy consumption leading to cumulative greenhouse gas emissions of 4-11% of the 1.5 degrees C emission budget. Glass demand might still exceed current float-glass production, requiring capacity expansion; and silver consumption could be kept at current levels. Installations costs would be 300-600 billion $US2020 per year. Technological solutions enabling such learning are foreseeable, nevertheless current and future investments must not only be targeted at capacity expansion but also at upholding the currently high rate of innovation.","[Goldschmidt, Jan Christoph; Wagner, Lukas; Friedrich, Lorenz] Fraunhofer Inst Solar Energy Syst, Heidenhofstr 2, D-79110 Freiburg, Germany; [Pietzcker, Robert] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, POB 60 12 03, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany",Fraunhofer Gesellschaft; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung,"Goldschmidt, JC (corresponding author), Fraunhofer Inst Solar Energy Syst, Heidenhofstr 2, D-79110 Freiburg, Germany.",jan.christoph.goldschmidt@ise.fraunhofer.de; lukas.wagner@ise.fraunhofer.de; pietzcker@pik-potsdam.de; lorenz.friedrich@ise.fraunhofer.de,"Wagner, Lukas/ABO-9943-2022; Goldschmidt, Jan Christoph/C-1807-2008","Goldschmidt, Jan Christoph/0000-0003-3256-1366; , Lorenz/0000-0003-1397-2493; Wagner, Lukas/0000-0002-6883-5886; Pietzcker, Robert/0000-0002-9403-6711",Fraunhofer Lighthouse Project MaNiTU; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [730403]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [FKZ 03SFK5A]; German Federal Environmental Foundation (DBU),Fraunhofer Lighthouse Project MaNiTU; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); German Federal Environmental Foundation (DBU),This work was supported by the Fraunhofer Lighthouse Project MaNiTU.

Considering demand for fertilizers, as well as its future potential as a dispatchable energy vector, sustainable synthesis of ammonia is being explored as an alternative to the capital- and carbon-intensive fossil-fuel-driven Haber-Bosch process. Here we assess stages along a transition to the sustainable synthesis of ammonia, looking at economic feasibility and climate impacts compared to the incumbent Haber-Bosch without and with CO2 capture. This analysis enables us to suggest technological thresholds for sustainable synthesis of ammonia to become economically and environmentally favourable. When driven by renewable energy sources, the water electrolyzer (near $400 per kW) coupled Haber-Bosch process will reach cost parity near 2.5 cents per kWh electricity. In the case of direct electrochemical ammonia synthesis, achieving cost-parity using the same 2.5 cents per kWh electricity will rely on achieving major advances in performance: an electrolysis full-cell energy efficiency exceeding 40% at a current density of 0.5 A cm(-2). Once this operating performance is reached, electrically-powered ammonia synthesis will bring climate benefits when coupled with low-carbon electricity (<180 gCO(2e) per kWh), achievable when over half of today's U.S. electricity generation is supplied by renewable energy sources. We conclude with a forward-looking perspective on the key challenges and opportunities for sustainable ammonia synthesis routes to be competitive with the incumbent Haber-Bosch process in the future.","[Wang, Miao; Khan, Mohd A.; Mohsin, Imtinan; Sumon, Kazi Z.; Gates, Ian D.; Kibria, Md Golam] Univ Calgary, Dept Chem & Petr Engn, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Wicks, Joshua; Ip, Alexander H.; Sargent, Edward H.] Univ Toronto, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, 10 Kings Coll Rd, Toronto, ON M5S 3G4, Canada; [Dinh, Cao-Thang] Queens Univ, Dept Chem Engn, 19 Div St, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada",University of Calgary; University of Toronto; Queens University - Canada,"Gates, ID; Kibria, MG (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Dept Chem & Petr Engn, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.;Sargent, EH (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, 10 Kings Coll Rd, Toronto, ON M5S 3G4, Canada.",ted.sargent@utoronto.ca; idgates@ucalgary.ca; md.kibria@ucalgary.ca,"Dinh, Cao Thang/AAE-7837-2019","Dinh, Cao Thang/0000-0001-9641-9815; Gates, Ian/0000-0001-9551-6752; Wicks, Joshua/0000-0001-7819-1167; WANG, MIAO/0000-0002-0107-6264; Khan, Mohd Adnan/0000-0001-6280-6171; Sumon, Kazi/0000-0001-7986-6162","University of Calgary's Canada First Research Excellence Fund program, entitled the Global Research Initiative in Sustainable Low Carbon Unconventional Resources","University of Calgary's Canada First Research Excellence Fund program, entitled the Global Research Initiative in Sustainable Low Carbon Unconventional Resources","The authors acknowledge support from the University of Calgary's Canada First Research Excellence Fund program, entitled the Global Research Initiative in Sustainable Low Carbon Unconventional Resources.

In this review, we explore what is known today about the status of installed crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules in the world, how different sources classify module defects, and what we might deduce for future installations. Looking at more than 200 results from 132 installations and 79 reports, we find that PV modules in general are robust in outdoor operation, with about one in 250 modules failing completely each year. About one in ten modules will develop a defect resulting in greater than expected power loss throughout their lifetime, and practically every module will develop visually perceivable alterations. We observe no trends of changes over time in these findings, hence there is no indication that future performance will deviate dramatically. We note though that more information is needed. Available studies represent a module fleet with greater age than current installations, and are over-representing multicrystalline - compared to monocrystalline silicon, and AL-BSF - compared to PERC cell architectures. Studies from Asia and Africa and from tropical climates are underrepresented. A major challenge in the analysis was the variety of metrics used.

Past studies on thermal electricity-water nexus have not accounted for this new capacity, and use coarse spatial and temporal resolutions in the assessment of long-term power system reliability. Here, high-resolution hydro-climatic simulations and asset-level power plant water use models are integrated to quantify water constraints on coal-fired power plants in Developing Asia, for different scenarios of future climate change, cooling system choice, and capacity expansion. Future climate change and capacity expansion decrease the annual usable capacity factor (UF) of coal power generation in Mongolia, Southeast Asia, and parts of India and China. The negative impacts are lessened by widening the geographic areas of aggregation. Under near-term mitigation scenarios with high penetrations of CO2 capture technology, the regional average water withdrawal intensity of coal power generation is 50-80% higher than current conditions. With careful siting, the increased water withdrawal intensity does not necessarily constrain future electricity production on annual or monthly time scales, but decreases system reliability by increasing the probability of low UF at daily time scale. Our findings highlight the unaccounted-for-risk in Developing Asia's long-term power plan featuring coal power generation. Regional capacity expansion should consider the reliability of future thermal power assets under long-term hydroclimate change using high-resolution models and multiple scenarios.","[Wang, Yaoping; Bielicki, Jeffrey M.] Ohio State Univ, Environm Sci Grad Program, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Wang, Yaoping; Byers, Edward; Parkinson, Simon; Wada, Yoshihide] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Laxenburg, Austria; [Parkinson, Simon] Univ Victoria, Inst Integrated Energy Syst, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Wanders, Niko] Univ Utrecht, Dept Phys Geog, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Mao, Jiafu] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Environm Sci Div, Oak Ridge, TN USA; [Mao, Jiafu] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Climate Change Sci Inst, Oak Ridge, TN USA; [Bielicki, Jeffrey M.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Civil Environm & Geodet Engn, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Bielicki, Jeffrey M.] Ohio State Univ, John Glenn Coll Publ Affairs, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Wang, Yaoping] Univ Tennessee, Inst Secure & Sustainable Environm, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); University of Victoria; Utrecht University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Wang, YP (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Environm Sci Grad Program, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.;Wang, YP (corresponding author), Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Laxenburg, Austria.",ywang254@utk.edu,"Bielicki, Jeffrey/D-4239-2016; Parkinson, Simon/AAF-4328-2019; Wanders, Niko/AAJ-2334-2021; Mao, Jiafu/B-9689-2012; Wada, Yoshihide/F-3595-2012","Bielicki, Jeffrey/0000-0001-8449-9328; Wanders, Niko/0000-0002-7102-5454; Mao, Jiafu/0000-0002-2050-7373; Wada, Yoshihide/0000-0003-4770-2539; Wang, Yaoping/0000-0002-5162-1910; Byers, Edward/0000-0003-0349-5742; Parkinson, Simon/0000-0002-4753-5198","Young Scientists Summer Program (U.S. National Member Organization); International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis; U.S. National Science Foundation Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy, and Water Systems (INFEWS) [1739909]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1739909] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Young Scientists Summer Program (U.S. National Member Organization); International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis; U.S. National Science Foundation Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy, and Water Systems (INFEWS); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","The authors thank funding support from the Young Scientists Summer Program (U.S. National Member Organization) and the Peccei Award of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, and the U.S. National Science Foundation Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy, and Water Systems (INFEWS) (Grant #1739909).

However, empical assessments on the latter are still limited. Using monthly data collected from 461 coal-fired power plants in China during the period from 2012 to 2014, this paper explores the influences of a suite of climatic factors and non-climatic factors on power generation efficiency. Furthermore, we project future consequences of efficiency with various climate change scenarios. We find significant heterogeneities in the impacts of temperatures across different types of power plants. On average, a 1 degrees C increase in monthly temperature is associated with an efficiency reduction of 0.09% and 0.32%, respectively, for electricity-only plants and electricity plus heat plants; this means that China's northern region-which has more electricity plus heat plants-is more vulnerable to climate change. Future projections suggest that efficiency reductions induced by climate change could lead to substantial power supply declines. Under the RCP8.5 scenarios, the power losses would reach 15.77 billion kW h per year in the 2050s, accounting for 13.5% of Beijing's electricity consumption in 2019. Back-of-the-envelope calculations show that the improvement in generation efficiency induced by the shut down of small and old units cannot fully offset the supply reduction by shut down itself. Factoring in the rapidly increasing power demands imposes more alarming challenges for stable and sustainable power supplies.","[Zhang, Hao; Fan, Jing-Li] China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Energy & Min Engn, Ctr Sustainable Dev & Energy Policy Res, Beijing 100083, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Da, Yabin] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77840 USA; [Zhang, Xian] Minist Sci & Technol MOST, Adm Ctr Chinas Agenda 21 ACCA21, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China",China University of Mining & Technology; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Fan, JL (corresponding author), China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Energy & Min Engn, Ctr Sustainable Dev & Energy Policy Res, Beijing 100083, Beijing, Peoples R China.",fan@cumtb.edu.cn,,"Fan, Jing-Li/0000-0003-2371-5845","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71874193, 71503249]; Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research [CBA2018-02MY-Fan]; Huo Yingdong Education Foundation [171072]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research; Huo Yingdong Education Foundation,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant (71874193, 71503249), the Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research (CBA2018-02MY-Fan), Huo Yingdong Education Foundation (171072).",,51,12,12,5,56,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",1754-5692,1754-5706,,ENERG ENVIRON SCI,Energy Environ.

Here, we provide a robust, holistic, and accessible framework for researchers to use to assess these impacts for any battery material. The framework addresses four key issues present during the battery manufacturing process: (i) total energy use and emissions, (ii) toxicity, (iii) habitat destruction, and (iv) social impact. This article also includes example impact assessments for three battery chemistries that are being intensely pursued for current and future energy storage applications: (i) LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811)-graphite, (ii) LiFePO4 (LFP)-graphite, and (iii) aqueous Na-ion. Based on the results of these assessments, we offer the following recommendations for making batteries more environmentally and socially responsible. First, given the human rights issues related to its extraction, cobalt usage must be eliminated entirely. To reduce energy use and emissions, the N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) solvent should be eliminated. To reduce battery toxicity significantly, low toxicity electrolyte salts and non-toxic binders should be used. Iron and manganese-based cathodes are less toxic, less energy-intensive alternatives to cobalt and nickel-based cathodes. Lastly, to preserve habitat, sodium should be used over lithium for grid storage and cellulose separators over polyethylene separators for all applications.","[Sharma, Shyam S.; Manthiram, Arumugam] Univ Texas Austin, Texas Mat Inst, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Manthiram, A (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Texas Mat Inst, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",manth@austin.utexas.edu,,"Sharma, Shyam/0000-0003-4777-3222","University of Texas at Austin, Energy Institute (Office of the Vice President for Research) under the interdisciplinary Fueling a Sustainable Energy Transition (FSET) grant","University of Texas at Austin, Energy Institute (Office of the Vice President for Research) under the interdisciplinary Fueling a Sustainable Energy Transition (FSET) grant","This work was supported by the University of Texas at Austin, Energy Institute (in partnership with the Office of the Vice President for Research) under the interdisciplinary Fueling a Sustainable Energy Transition (FSET) grant.

Ocean wave energy is an abundant and relatively stable source of renewable energy, which would be highly desirable for the conversion of CO2 to conveniently stored and transported liquid fuels. In this work, we demonstrate a wave-energy-driven electrochemical CO2 reduction system, consisting of triboelectric nanogenerators, a supercapacitor and a CO2 reduction reactor, that converts ocean wave energy to chemical energy in the form of formic acid, a liquid fuel. We optimize the energy storage component of the system and operation voltage of the electrochemical cell to achieve efficient energy storage and maximize the production of formic acid. Under simulated waves, the system can produce 2.798 mu mol of formic acid per day via the wave energy harvested from a water surface area of 0.04 m(2). Moreover, we have performed field tests in the Red Sea to demonstrate the practicality of such an electrochemical CO2 reduction system. Finally, we present design guidelines for achieving a cost-effective, efficient, and large-scale wave-energy-driven CO2 reduction system for liquid fuel production.","[Leung, Siu-Fung; Fu, Hui-Chun; Zhang, Maolin; Hassan, Ali H.; Salama, Khaled N.; He, Jr-Hau] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Comp Elect & Math Sci & Engn, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia; [Jiang, Tao] Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Ctr Excellence Nanosci, Beijing Inst Nanoenergy & Nanosyst, Beijing Key Lab Micronano Energy & Sensor, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhonglin] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [He, Jr-Hau] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","King Abdullah University of Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Beijing Institute of Nanoenergy & Nanosystems, CAS; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; City University of Hong Kong","He, JH (corresponding author), King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Comp Elect & Math Sci & Engn, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia.;He, JH (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",jrhauhe@cityu.edu.hk,"salama, khaled Nabil/K-3689-2019; Leung, Siu Fung/N-9819-2014; He, Jr-Hau/Y-2620-2019; He, Jr-Hau/B-5141-2011; jiang, tao/GWC-7108-2022; Wang, Zhong Lin/E-2176-2011","salama, khaled Nabil/0000-0001-7742-1282; Leung, Siu Fung/0000-0001-6417-7815; He, Jr-Hau/0000-0003-1886-9241; He, Jr-Hau/0000-0003-1886-9241; Jiang, Tao/0000-0001-7941-7703; Hassan, Ali H./0000-0002-6192-9871; Wang, Zhong Lin/0000-0002-5530-0380",Office of Sponsored Research of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST); KAUST Sensor Initiative; City University of Hong Kong,Office of Sponsored Research of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST); KAUST Sensor Initiative; City University of Hong Kong(City University of Hong Kong),"This work was financially supported by the Office of Sponsored Research of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), the KAUST Sensor Initiative and the City University of Hong Kong startup funding.",,36,75,76,9,142,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",1754-5692,1754-5706,,ENERG ENVIRON SCI,Energy Environ.
