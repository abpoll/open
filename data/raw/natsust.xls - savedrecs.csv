We analyse the potential co-benefits for SO2, NOx, particulate matter (PM) and CO2 emission reduction in major industrial sectors in China. We construct and analyse a firm-level database covering nearly 80 observations and use scenario simulations to estimate the co-benefits. The findings show that substantial co-benefits could be achieved with three specific interventions. Energy intensity improvement can reduce SO2, NOx, PM and CO2 emissions for non-power sectors by 26-44%, 19-44%, 25-46% and 18-50%, respectively. Reductions from scale structure adjustment such as phasing out small firms and developing large ones can amount to 1-8%, 1-6%, 2-20% and 0.2-3%. Electrification can reduce emissions by 19-25%, 4-28%, 20-29% and 11-12% if the share of electricity generated from non-fossil fuel sources is 70%. Since firm heterogeneity is essential to realize the co-benefits and directly determines the magnitudes of these benefits, stricter and sensible environmental policies targeting industrial firms can accelerate China's sustainable transformation.","[Qian, Haoqi] Fudan Univ, Inst Global Publ Policy, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Qian, Haoqi] Fudan Univ, LSE Fudan Res Ctr Global Publ Policy, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Xu, Shaodan; Ren, Feizhou; Wu, Libo] Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Xu, Shaodan; Ren, Feizhou; Wu, Libo] Fudan Univ, Ctr Energy Econ & Strategy Studies, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Cao, Jing] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wei, Wendong] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Int & Publ Affairs, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wei, Wendong] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, SJTU UNIDO Joint Inst Inclus & Sustainable Ind De, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Meng, Jing] UCL, Bartlett Sch Construct & Project Management, London, England; [Wu, Libo] Fudan Univ, Inst Big Data, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Fudan University; Fudan University; Fudan University; Fudan University; Tsinghua University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; University of London; University College London; Fudan University,"Wu, LB (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Wu, LB (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Ctr Energy Econ & Strategy Studies, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Wei, WD (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Int & Publ Affairs, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Wei, WD (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, SJTU UNIDO Joint Inst Inclus & Sustainable Ind De, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Meng, J (corresponding author), UCL, Bartlett Sch Construct & Project Management, London, England.;Wu, LB (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Inst Big Data, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",wendongwei@sjtu.edu.cn; jing.j.meng@ucl.ac.uk; wulibo@fudan.edu.cn,"Qian, Haoqi/L-7579-2019; Wei, Wendong/GZM-4220-2022; Meng, Jing/J-9740-2013","Meng, Jing/0000-0001-8708-0485; Qian, Haoqi/0000-0001-5156-4402; Wu, Libo/0000-0002-3953-526X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71925010, 71703027, 71904125, 72088101, 71690244]; National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFC1509007, 2016YFA0602604]; Shanghai Sailing Program [18YF1417500]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key R&D Program of China; Shanghai Sailing Program,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos 71925010, 71703027, 71904125, 72088101 and 71690244), the National Key R&D Program of China (grant nos 2018YFC1509007 and 2016YFA0602604) and the Shanghai Sailing Program (grant no. 18YF1417500).",,60,82,82,87,419,NATURE RESEARCH,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2398-9629,,,NAT SUSTAIN,Nat.

However, the extent and dynamics of deforestation driven by commodity expansion are largely unknown. Here we mapped annual soybean expansion in South America between 2000 and 2019 by combining satellite observations and sample field data. From 2000 to 2019, the area cultivated with soybean more than doubled from 26.4 Mha to 55.1 Mha. Most soybean expansion occurred on pastures originally converted from natural vegetation for cattle production. The most rapid expansion occurred in the Brazilian Amazon, where soybean area increased more than tenfold, from 0.4 Mha to 4.6 Mha. Across the continent, 9% of forest loss was converted to soybean by 2016. Soybean-driven deforestation was concentrated at the active frontiers, nearly half located in the Brazilian Cerrado. Efforts to limit future deforestation must consider how soybean expansion may drive deforestation indirectly by displacing pasture or other land uses. Holistic approaches that track land use across all commodities coupled with vegetation monitoring are required to maintain critical ecosystem services. Deforestation is often driven by land conversion for growing commodity crops. This study finds that, between 2000 and 2019, most soybean expansion in South America was on pastures converted originally for cattle production, especially in the Brazilian Amazon. More soy-driven deforestation occurred in the Brazilian Cerrado.","[Song, Xiao-Peng] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Geosci, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Song, Xiao-Peng; Hansen, Matthew C.; Potapov, Peter; Adusei, Bernard; Pickering, Jeffrey; Lima, Andre; Zalles, Viviana; Hernandez-Serna, Andres; Jantz, Samuel M.; Pickens, Amy H.; Turubanova, Svetlana; Tyukavina, Alexandra] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Adami, Marcos] INPE, Amazon Spatial Coordinat, Belem, Para, Brazil; [Stehman, Stephen, V] SUNY Syracuse, Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Di Bella, Carlos M.; Conde, Maria C.] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Agron, Dept Metodos Cuantitativos & Sistemas Informac, SIG,Cartog & Teledetecc, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Copati, Esteban J.] Buenos Aires Grain Exchange, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Fernandes, Lucas B.] Companhia Nacl Abastecimento, Gerencia Geotecnol, Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE); State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) College of Environmental Science & Forestry; University of Buenos Aires,"Song, XP (corresponding author), Texas Tech Univ, Dept Geosci, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.;Song, XP; Hansen, MC (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",xiaopeng.song@ttu.edu; mhansen@umd.edu,"Adami, Marcos/AAK-8358-2020; Tyukavina, Alexandra/AGW-0785-2022; Stehman, Stephen/AAZ-6801-2021; potapov, peter/AAE-7388-2019","Adami, Marcos/0000-0003-4247-4477; potapov, peter/0000-0003-3977-0021; Song, Xiao-Peng/0000-0002-5514-0321; Stehman, Stephen/0000-0001-5234-2027","Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation [7864]; NASA Land-Cover and Land-Use Change Program [NNX15AK65G, 80NSSC20K1490]; USGS Landsat Science Team [140G0118C0013]; NASA Harvest Program [80NSSC18M0039]; CNPq (National Council for Scientific and Technological Development) [306334/2020-8]; NASA [799148, NNX15AK65G] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation(Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation); NASA Land-Cover and Land-Use Change Program(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); USGS Landsat Science Team; NASA Harvest Program; CNPq (National Council for Scientific and Technological Development)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)),"This study was funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation (7864, M.C.H.), the NASA Land-Cover and Land-Use Change Program (NNX15AK65G, M.C.H. and 80NSSC20K1490, X.-P.S.), the USGS Landsat Science Team (140G0118C0013, M.C.H.) and the NASA Harvest Program (80NSSC18M0039, M.C.H.).

This study finds that intercropping increases grain yields and their stability and that yield benefits increase over time. Population and income growth are increasing global food demand at a time when a third of the world's agricultural soils are degraded and climate variability threatens the sustainability of food production. Intercropping, the practice of growing two or more spatially intermingled crops, often increases yields, but whether such yield increases, their stability and soil fertility can be sustained over time remains unclear. Using four long-term (10-16 years) experiments on soils of differing fertility, we found that grain yields in intercropped systems were on average 22% greater than in matched monocultures and had greater year-to-year stability. Moreover, relative to monocultures, yield benefits of intercropping increased through time, suggesting that intercropping may increase soil fertility via observed increases in soil organic matter, total nitrogen and macro-aggregates when comparing intercropped with monoculture soils. Our results suggest that wider adoption of intercropping could increase both crop production and its long-term sustainability.","[Li, Xiao-Fei; Wang, Zhi-Gang; Wu, Jin-Pu; Liu, Xin-Ru; Tian, Xiu-Li; Wang, Yu; Li, Jian-Peng; Wang, Yan; Xia, Hai-Yong; Mei, Pei-Pei; Wang, Xiao-Feng; Yu, Rui-Peng; Zhang, Wei-Ping; Li, Long] China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Key Lab Plant & Soil Interact, Beijing Key Lab Biodivers & Organ Farming,Minist, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Bao, Xing-Guo; Sun, Jian-Hao; Yang, Si-Cun; Wang, Cheng-Bao; Zhao, Jian-Hua; Che, Zong-Xian] Gansu Acad Agr Sci, Inst Soils Fertilizers & Water Saving Agr, Lanzhou, Peoples R China; [Wang, Ping; Gui, Lin-Guo] Ningxia Acad Agr & Forestry Sci, Inst Crop Sci, Yinchuan, Ningxia, Peoples R China; [Callaway, Ragan M.] Univ Montana, Div Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Callaway, Ragan M.] Univ Montana, Inst Ecosyst, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Tilman, David] Univ Minnesota, Dept Ecol Evolut & Behav, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Tilman, David] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Li, Xiao-Fei] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Cotton Res, State Key Lab Cotton Biol, Anyang, Peoples R China; [Xia, Hai-Yong] Shandong Acad Agr Sci, Crop Res Inst, Jinan, Peoples R China; [Mei, Pei-Pei] Henan Inst Sci & Technol, Coll Life Sci & Technol, Xinxiang, Henan, Peoples R China","China Agricultural University; Gansu Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Crop Sciences, CAAS; Ningxia Academy of Agricultural & Forestry Sciences; University of Montana System; University of Montana; University of Montana System; University of Montana; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Cotton Research, CAAS; Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Henan Institute of Science & Technology","Li, L (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm Sci, Key Lab Plant & Soil Interact, Beijing Key Lab Biodivers & Organ Farming,Minist, Beijing, Peoples R China.",lilong@cau.edu.cn,"Li, xiaofei/GXF-7187-2022; Li, Xiao-Fei/ABB-4458-2022; Tilman, David/ABD-5309-2021; Zhang, Wei-Ping/HKM-7917-2023; Li, Long/A-4998-2013","Zhang, Wei-Ping/0000-0002-7769-1255; Li, Long/0000-0003-0523-3308; Wu, Jinpu/0000-0001-9666-2399; Li, Xiao-Fei/0000-0002-5530-1578; wang, wang zhi gang/0000-0002-0520-9052; Tian, Xiuli/0000-0002-8555-3821",National Natural Science Foundation of China [31430014]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFD0300202]; National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) [2011CB100405]; National Science Foundation EPSCoR Cooperative Agreement [OIA-1757351],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(National Basic Research Program of China); National Science Foundation EPSCoR Cooperative Agreement(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank all members involved in the maintenance of the long-term field experiments.

This discharge creates acute microplastic contamination of river beds that threatens biodiversity and the quality of riverine habitats. Wastewater discharge to rivers is a controversial practice that compromises water quality, aquatic habitats and human health worldwide. Here we show how untreated wastewater laced with microplastics and raw sewage is routinely discharged into UK river flows that are too low to disperse the microplastics downstream. These 'dry weather' spills lead to acute microplastic contamination of river bed habitats. Many aquatic fauna feed in the benthic zone, the quality of which affects the entire riverine ecosystem. All microplastic types accumulate to high concentrations on the channel bed until flushed downstream by floods. These findings pose fundamental questions about the sustainable management of urban wastewater. Treating the wastewater would shut down the major source of microplastic fragments and microbeads in such rivers and prevent their transport to the ocean. Riverine microplastic transport is primarily partitioned between: (1) continuous transport at low concentrations of synthetic fibres from treated wastewater effluent; and (2) episodic flood-driven transport of the full microplastic assemblage entrained from contaminated channel beds. Focusing only on the buoyant non-flood microplastic load can produce highly unrepresentative assessments of riverine microplastic contamination. Climate warming and urban population growth will intensify the microplastic burden on many river ecosystems as summer baseflows decline and wastewater fluxes increase.","[Woodward, Jamie; Li, Jiawei; Rothwell, James; Hurley, Rachel] Univ Manchester, Dept Geog, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Hurley, Rachel] Norwegian Inst Water Res, Oslo, Norway",N8 Research Partnership; University of Manchester; Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA),"Woodward, J (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Dept Geog, Manchester, Lancs, England.",jamie.woodward@manchester.ac.uk,"Li, Jiawe/HMD-5862-2023; Li, Jiawei/AAR-5540-2021; Hurley, Rachel R/P-7812-2018","Li, Jiawei/0000-0002-6661-6946; Hurley, Rachel R/0000-0001-9716-2484; Woodward, Jamie/0000-0002-6709-0050",,,,,56,54,54,35,180,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2398-9629,,,NAT SUSTAIN,Nat.

A quantitative analysis of the carbon implications of expanding the transmission infrastructure would shed light on the trade-offs among three connected dimensions of sustainable development, namely, climate change mitigation, energy access and infrastructure development. By collecting a high-resolution inventory, we developed an assessment framework of, and analysed, the GHG emissions caused by China's power transmission infrastructure construction during 1990-2017. We show that cumulative embodied GHG emissions have dramatically increased by more than 7.3 times those in 1990, reaching 0.89 GtCO(2)-equivalent in 2017.

We evaluate a series of large-scale tree planting programmes using data collected from historical Landsat imagery in the state of Himachal Pradesh in Northern India. Using this panel dataset, we use an event study design to estimate the socioeconomic and biophysical impacts over decades of these programmes. We find that tree plantings have not, on average, increased the proportion of forest canopy cover and have modestly shifted forest composition away from the broadleaf varieties valued by local people. Further cross-sectional analysis, from a household livelihood survey, shows that tree planting supports little direct use by local people. We conclude that decades of expensive tree planting programmes in this region have not proved effective. This result suggests that large-scale tree planting may sometimes fail to achieve its climate mitigation and livelihood goals. Large-scale tree planting programmes have been implemented or planned for areas around the world suffering from deforestation, but this study presents evidence that such efforts may not necessarily deliver the desired environmental and economic outcomes.","[Coleman, Eric A.] Florida State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Schultz, Bill] Univ Chicago, Social Sci Collegiate Div, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Ramprasad, Vijay] Ctr Ecol Dev & Res, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India; [Ramprasad, Vijay; Guleria, Vijay; Rana, Rajesh] Kangra Integrated Sci & Adaptat Network, Kangra, India; [Fischer, Harry] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Urban & Rural Dev, Uppsala, Sweden; [Rana, Pushpendra] Indian Forest Serv, Shimla, Himachal Prades, India; [Filippi, Anthony M.; Guneralp, Burak; Ma, Andong] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Geog, College Stn, TX USA; [Rodriguez Solorzano, Claudia; Fleischman, Forrest] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University; University of Chicago; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Coleman, EA (corresponding author), Florida State Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",ecoleman@fsu.edu,"RANA, RAJESH/AHC-0211-2022; Rana, Pushpendra/AGK-5348-2022; Fleischman, Forrest/I-8703-2016; Guneralp, Burak/Y-3616-2019","Rana, Pushpendra/0000-0001-8626-3351; Fleischman, Forrest/0000-0001-6060-4031; Guneralp, Burak/0000-0002-5825-0630; Coleman, Eric/0000-0002-5315-7111; Fischer, Harry/0000-0001-7967-1154; Ramprasad, Vijay/0000-0003-2636-0090",NASA Land Cover and Land Use Change (LULUC) [NNX17AK14G],NASA Land Cover and Land Use Change (LULUC),"We thank our field researchers for data collection.

This study shows that lifting people out of poverty does not impact much emissions globally, though in poorer countries emissions could more than double. Wealth and income are disproportionately distributed among the global population. This has direct consequences on consumption patterns and consumption-based carbon footprints, resulting in carbon inequality. Due to persistent inequality, millions of people still live in poverty today. On the basis of global expenditure data, we compute country- and expenditure-specific per capita carbon footprints with unprecedented details. We show that they can reach several hundred tons of CO2 per year, while the majority of people living below poverty lines have yearly carbon footprints of less than 1 tCO(2). Reaching targets under United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 1, lifting more than one billion people out of poverty, leads to only small relative increases in global carbon emissions of 1.6-2.1% or less. Nevertheless, carbon emissions in low- and lower-middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa can more than double as an effect of poverty alleviation. To ensure global progress on poverty alleviation without overshooting climate targets, high-emitting countries need to reduce their emissions substantially.","[Bruckner, Benedikt; Hubacek, Klaus; Shan, Yuli] Univ Groningen, Energy & Sustainabil Res Inst Groningen, Integrated Res Energy Environm & Soc IREES, Groningen, Netherlands; [Zhong, Honglin] Shandong Univ, Weihai Inst Interdisciplinary Res, Inst Blue & Green Dev, Weihai, Peoples R China; [Feng, Kuishuang] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University of Groningen; Shandong University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Hubacek, K; Shan, YL (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Energy & Sustainabil Res Inst Groningen, Integrated Res Energy Environm & Soc IREES, Groningen, Netherlands.",k.hubacek@rug.nl; y.shan@rug.nl,"Hubacek, Klaus/K-3500-2019; Bruckner, Benedikt/HKO-6699-2023; Shan, Yuli/N-7747-2015; Hubacek, Klaus/GVS-6444-2022","Bruckner, Benedikt/0000-0002-1852-895X; Shan, Yuli/0000-0002-5215-8657; Bruckner, Benedikt/0000-0003-3613-8880; Hubacek, Klaus/0000-0003-2561-6090",National Natural Science Foundation of China [72174111]; Shandong Natural Science Foundation of China [ZR2021MG013]; Major Program of National Social Science Foundation of China [21ZDA065],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shandong Natural Science Foundation of China(Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province); Major Program of National Social Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We thank O.

The carbon released through the burning of fossil fuels would take millennia to regenerate on Earth. Though the timeframe of carbon recovery for ecosystems such as peatlands, mangroves and old-growth forests is shorter (centuries), this timeframe still exceeds the time we have remaining to avoid the worst impacts of global warming. There are some natural places that we cannot afford to lose due to their irreplaceable carbon reserves. Here we map 'irrecoverable carbon' globally to identify ecosystem carbon that remains within human purview to manage and, if lost, could not be recovered by mid-century, by when we need to reach net-zero emissions to avoid the worst climate impacts. Since 2010, agriculture, logging and wildfire have caused emissions of at least 4.0 Gt of irrecoverable carbon. The world's remaining 139.1 +/- 443.6 Gt of irrecoverable carbon faces risks from land-use conversion and climate change. These risks can be reduced through proactive protection and adaptive management. Currently, 23.0% of irrecoverable carbon is within protected areas and 33.6% is managed by Indigenous peoples and local communities. Half of Earth's irrecoverable carbon is concentrated on just 3.3% of its land, highlighting opportunities for targeted efforts to increase global climate security. Avoiding catastrophic climate change requires that we avoid losing key natural carbon reserves. This study maps such irrecoverable carbon globally and finds a third of the remaining managed by Indigenous peoples and local communities and nearly a quarter in protected areas.","[Noon, Monica L.; Goldstein, Allie; Roehrdanz, Patrick R.; Wright, Timothy Maxwell; Hole, David G.; Turner, Will R.] Conservat Int, Arlington, VA 22202 USA; [Ledezma, Juan Carlos] Conservat Int, La Paz, Bolivia; [Cook-Patton, Susan C.] Nature Conservancy, 1815 N Lynn St, Arlington, VA USA; [Spawn-Lee, Seth A.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Geog, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Spawn-Lee, Seth A.] Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Sustainabil & Global Environm, Nelson Inst Environm Studies, Madison, WI USA; [Gonzalez-Roglich, Mariano] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Rockstroem, Johan] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Potsdam, Germany",Conservation International; Nature Conservancy; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung,"Noon, ML (corresponding author), Conservat Int, Arlington, VA 22202 USA.",mnoon@conservation.org,"Hole, David/Q-1692-2019","Hole, David/0000-0001-9117-2956; Goldstein, Allie/0000-0002-2719-5990; Roehrdanz, Patrick/0000-0003-4047-5011; Spawn-Lee, Seth/0000-0001-8821-5345; Ledezma, Juan Carlos/0000-0001-6653-4791; Rockstrom, Johan/0000-0001-8988-2983",Betty and Gordon Moore to Conservation International; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program [DGE-1747503],Betty and Gordon Moore to Conservation International; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank the following researchers for their contribution to this study: B.

Growing perennial grasses on recently abandoned cropland is a near-term strategy for gradual bioenergy deployment with reduced risks for food security and the environment. However, the extent of global abandoned cropland, bioenergy potentials and management requirements are unclear. Here we integrate satellite-derived land cover maps with a yield model to investigate the land-energy-water nexus of global bioenergy potentials. We identified 83 million hectares of abandoned cropland between 1992 and 2015, corresponding to 5% of today's cropland area. Bioenergy potentials are 6-39 exajoules per year (11-68% of today's bioenergy demand), depending on multiple local and management factors. About 20 exajoules per year can be achieved by increasing today's global cropland area and water use by 3% and 8%, respectively, and without production inside biodiversity hotspots or irrigation in water-scarce areas. The consideration of context-specific practices and multiple environmental dimensions can mitigate trade-offs of bioenergy deployment. Bioenergy from grasses is a key option to mitigate climate change. This study finds that recently abandoned cropland could help meet 11-68% of today's bioenergy demand.","[Naess, Jan Sandstad; Cavalett, Otavio; Cherubini, Francesco] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Energy & Proc Engn, Ind Ecol Programme, Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Naess, JS (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Energy & Proc Engn, Ind Ecol Programme, Trondheim, Norway.",jan.s.nass@ntnu.no,"Naess, Jan Sandstad/AAW-6187-2021","Naess, Jan Sandstad/0000-0003-3166-913X",Norwegian Research Council through the project Bio4Fuels [257622]; Norwegian Research Council through the project BioPath [293434]; Norwegian Research Council through the project MitiStress [286773],Norwegian Research Council through the project Bio4Fuels; Norwegian Research Council through the project BioPath; Norwegian Research Council through the project MitiStress,"The support of the Norwegian Research Council is acknowledged through the projects Bio4Fuels (project no. 257622), BioPath (project no. 293434) and MitiStress (project no. 286773).

This study finds increasing mountain forest loss there, with the clearing frontier moving higher in the 2010s and causing unprecedented carbon loss. Southeast Asia contains about half of all tropical mountain forests, which are rich in biodiversity and carbon stocks, yet there is debate as to whether regional mountain forest cover has increased or decreased in recent decades. Here, our analysis of high-resolution satellite datasets reveals increasing mountain forest loss across Southeast Asia. Total mean annual forest loss was 3.22 Mha yr(-1) during 2001-2019, with 31% occurring on the mountains. In the 2010s, the frontier of forest loss moved to higher elevations (15.1 +/- 3.8 m yr(-1) during 2011-2019, P < 0.01) and steeper slopes (0.22 +/- 0.05 degrees yr(-1) during 2009-2019, P < 0.01) that have high forest carbon density relative to the lowlands. These shifts led to unprecedented annual forest carbon loss of 424 Tg C yr(-1), accelerating at a rate of 18 +/- 4 Tg C yr(-2) (P < 0.01) from 2001 to 2019. Our results underscore the immediate threat of carbon stock losses associated with accelerating forest clearance in Southeast Asian mountains, which jeopardizes international climate agreements and biodiversity conservation.","[Feng, Yu; Liu, Yang; He, Xinyue; Jiang, Xin; Zheng, Chunmiao; Zeng, Zhenzhong] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, State Environm Protect Key Lab Integrated Surfac, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Feng, Yu] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Civil Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Elsen, Paul R.] Mae Jo Univ, Fac Fisheries Technol & Aquat Resources, Chiang Mai, Thailand; [Elsen, Paul R.] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Global Conservat Program, Bronx, NY USA; [He, Xinyue; Spracklen, Dominick V.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Holden, Joseph] Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",Southern University of Science & Technology; University of Hong Kong; Maejo University; Wildlife Conservation Society; N8 Research Partnership; White Rose University Consortium; University of Leeds; N8 Research Partnership; White Rose University Consortium; University of Leeds,"Zeng, ZZ (corresponding author), Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, State Environm Protect Key Lab Integrated Surfac, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.",zengzz@sustech.edu.cn,"Elsen, Paul/H-9567-2019; , dr dr/AAA-5406-2022; Zheng, Chunmiao/I-5257-2014; Spracklen, Dominick/AAA-6257-2019; Zeng, Zhenzhong/GQR-0044-2022","Elsen, Paul/0000-0002-9953-7961; Zheng, Chunmiao/0000-0001-5839-1305; He, Xinyue/0000-0002-2214-9338; Holden, Joseph/0000-0002-1108-4831; Feng, Yu/0000-0001-6433-5035","National Natural Science Foundation of China [42071022, 41861124003, 41890852]; Southern University of Science and Technology [29/Y01296122]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Southern University of Science and Technology,"Z.Z. and C.Z. were supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos. 42071022, 41861124003 and 41890852).

With hydrologic and techno-economic simulations of solar panels covering California's canal network, this study shows the advantages of covering canals with solar panels. Solar power development over canals is an emerging response to the energy-water-food nexus that can result in multiple benefits for water and energy infrastructure. Case studies of over-canal solar photovoltaic arrays have demonstrated enhanced photovoltaic performance due to the cooler microclimate next to the canal. In addition, shade from the photovoltaic panels has been shown to mitigate evaporation and potentially mitigate aquatic weed growth. However, the evaporation savings and financial co-benefits have not been quantified across major canal systems. Here we use regional hydrologic and techno-economic simulations of solar photovoltaic panels covering California's 6,350 km canal network, which is the world's largest conveyance system and covers a wide range of climates, insolation rates and water costs. We find that over-canal solar could reduce annual evaporation by an average of 39 +/- 12 thousand m(3) per km of canal. Furthermore, the financial benefits from shading the canals outweigh the added costs of the cable-support structures required to span the canals. The net present value of over-canal solar exceeds conventional overground solar by 20-50%, challenging the convention of leaving canals uncovered and calling into question our understanding of the most economic locations for solar power.","[McKuin, Brandi; Zumkehr, Andrew; Ta, Jenny; Bales, Roger; Viers, Joshua H.; Pathak, Tapan] Univ Calif Merced, Sierra Nevada Res Inst, Merced, CA 95340 USA; [McKuin, Brandi; Campbell, J.

This Article looks at over 300 cities globally to gauge the interactions of natural ecosystems with built infrastructure. Rapid urbanization throughout the globe increases demand for fresh water and the ecosystem services associated with it. This need is conventionally met through the construction of infrastructure. Natural infrastructure solutions have increased to provide freshwater ecosystem services, but little global research has examined the intricate relationships between built and natural infrastructure for providing freshwater ecosystem services to cities across the globe. Using network analysis, here we examine the interrelationships between built and natural infrastructure in 2,113 watersheds for 317 cities worldwide, focusing on four key freshwater ecosystem services: freshwater provision, sediment regulation, flood mitigation and hydropower production. Our results indicate that protected wetlands contribute to sustaining freshwater provision to cities. Forest cover in protected areas can improve the capacity of large dams in reducing sediment loads and producing hydropower, but cities mainly depend on reduced impervious surfaces and more green spaces within urban areas for flood mitigation. Improved understandings of the role of natural infrastructure in urban water networks must underpin strategic decision-making to sustainably provide freshwater ecosystem services to global cities.","[Chung, Min Gon; Frank, Kenneth A.; Dietz, Thomas; Liu, Jianguo] Michigan State Univ, Ctr Syst Integrat & Sustainabil, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Chung, Min Gon] Univ Calif Merced, Sierra Nevada Res Inst, Merced, CA USA; [Frank, Kenneth A.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Counseling Educ Psychol & Special Educ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Pokhrel, Yadu] Michigan State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Dietz, Thomas] Michigan State Univ, Dept Sociol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University; University of California System; University of California Merced; Michigan State University; Michigan State University; Michigan State University,"Liu, JG (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Ctr Syst Integrat & Sustainabil, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",liuji@msu.edu,"Pokhrel, Yadu/J-6440-2013; Pokhrel, Yadu/AAC-1776-2021; Liu, Jianguo/G-5211-2015; Chung, Min Gon/AAF-7277-2021","Pokhrel, Yadu/0000-0002-1367-216X; Liu, Jianguo/0000-0001-6344-0087; Chung, Min Gon/0000-0002-7177-7189","US National Science Foundation [1924111, 1752729]; Michigan AgBioResearch; Sustainable Michigan Endowment Project",US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Michigan AgBioResearch; Sustainable Michigan Endowment Project,"We thank S.

The food-energy-water (FEW) nexus describes interactions among domains that yield gains or trade-offs when analysed together rather than independently. In a project about renewable energy in rural Alaska communities, we applied this concept to examine the implications for sustainability and resilience. The FEW nexus provided a useful framework for identifying the cross-domain benefits of renewable energy, including gains in FEW security. However, other factors such as transportation and governance also play a major role in determining FEW security outcomes in rural Alaska. Here, we show the implications of our findings for theory and practice. The precise configurations of and relationships among FEW nexus components vary by place and time, and the range of factors involved further complicates the ability to develop a functional, systematic FEW model. Instead, we suggest how the FEW nexus may be applied conceptually to identify and understand cross-domain interactions that contribute to long-term sustainability and resilience.","[Huntington, Henry P.] Huntington Consulting, Eagle River, AK 99577 USA; [Schmidt, Jennifer I.] Univ Alaska Anchorage, Inst Social & Econ Res, Anchorage, AK USA; [Loring, Philip A.] Univ Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada; [Whitney, Erin; Byrd, Amanda G.; Huang, Daisy; Wilber, Michelle] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Alaska Ctr Energy & Power, Fairbanks, AK USA; [Aggarwal, Srijan] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Dept Civil Geol & Environm Engn, Fairbanks, AK USA; [Dev, Subhabrata; Schnabel, William E.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Northern Engn, Fairbanks, AK USA; [Dotson, Aaron D.] Univ Alaska Anchorage, Dept Civil Engn, Anchorage, AK USA; [Johnson, Barbara] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Dept Alaska Native Studies & Rural Dev, Fairbanks, AK USA; [Karenzi, Justus; Wies, Richard W., Jr.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Fairbanks, AK USA; [Penn, Henry J.

A quarter deliver over 80% of the proposed area and a fifth are inactive. After a 30-year hiatus, large-scale irrigation projects have returned to the development agenda in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). However, the magnitude and drivers of past schemes' performance remains poorly understood. We quantify the performance, measured as the proportion of proposed irrigated area delivered, of 79 irrigation schemes from across SSA by comparing planning documents with estimates of current scheme size from satellite-derived land-cover maps. We find overwhelming evidence that investments have failed to deliver promised benefits, with schemes supporting a median 16% of proposed area, only 20 (25%) delivering >80% and 16 (20%) completely inactive. Performance has not improved over six decades and we find limited relationships with commonly stated causes of failure such as scheme size and climate. We attribute these findings to political and management frameworks underpinning irrigation development in SSA. First, an emphasis on national food security promotes low-value crops, reducing economic viability. Second, proposals are unrealistically large, driven by optimism bias and political incentives. Finally, centralized bureaucracies lack the technical expertise, local knowledge and financial resources to ensure long-term maintenance. Our findings highlight the need for greater learning from past investments' outcomes if improvements in agricultural productivity and water security across SSA are to be realized.","[Higginbottom, Thomas P.; Foster, Timothy] Univ Manchester, Dept Mech Aerosp & Civil Engn, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Adhikari, Roshan; Dimova, Ralitza; Redicker, Sarah] Univ Manchester, Sch Environm Educ & Dev, Global Dev Inst, Manchester, Lancs, England",N8 Research Partnership; University of Manchester; N8 Research Partnership; University of Manchester,"Higginbottom, TP (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Dept Mech Aerosp & Civil Engn, Manchester, Lancs, England.",thomas.higginbottom@manchester.ac.uk,"Adhikari, Roshan/AAB-4377-2019","Adhikari, Roshan/0000-0002-1932-6225; Redicker, Sarah/0000-0002-3677-2585; Dimova, Ralitza/0000-0001-5977-0446",FutureDAMS project through the Global Challenges Research Fund from United Kingdom Research and Innovation (UKRI) [ES/P011373/1]; ESRC [ES/P011373/1] Funding Source: UKRI,FutureDAMS project through the Global Challenges Research Fund from United Kingdom Research and Innovation (UKRI); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This research was funded by the FutureDAMS project (grant code: ES/P011373/1), through the Global Challenges Research Fund from United Kingdom Research and Innovation (UKRI).",,57,24,24,1,20,NATURE RESEARCH,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2398-9629,,,NAT SUSTAIN,Nat.

We call for refocused conversation and united action towards rapidly deploying such systems across biophysical and socioeconomic settings.

This study finds that greater greenhouse gas emissions will worsen these impacts. Climate-driven redistribution of tuna threatens to disrupt the economies of Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and sustainable management of the world's largest tuna fishery. Here we show that by 2050, under a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario (RCP 8.5), the total biomass of three tuna species in the waters of ten Pacific SIDS could decline by an average of 13% (range = -5% to -20%) due to a greater proportion of fish occurring in the high seas. The potential implications for Pacific Island economies in 2050 include an average decline in purse-seine catch of 20% (range = -10% to -30%), an average annual loss in regional tuna-fishing access fees of US$90 million (range = -US$40 million to -US$140 million) and reductions in government revenue of up to 13% (range = -8% to -17%) for individual Pacific SIDS. Redistribution of tuna under a lower-emissions scenario (RCP 4.5) is projected to reduce the purse-seine catch from the waters of Pacific SIDS by an average of only 3% (range = -12% to +9%), indicating that even greater reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, in line with the Paris Agreement, would provide a pathway to sustainability for tuna-dependent Pacific Island economies. An additional pathway involves Pacific SIDS negotiating within the regional fisheries management organization to maintain the present-day benefits they receive from tuna, regardless of the effects of climate change on the distribution of the fish.","[Bell, Johann D.; Taei, Sue] Ctr Oceans Conservat Int, Arlington, VA 22230 USA; [Bell, Johann D.; Adams, Timothy; Hanich, Quentin; Harden-Davies, Harriet; Seto, Katherine L.; Tsamenyi, Martin] Univ Wollongong, Australian Natl Ctr Ocean Resources & Secur ANCOR, Wollongong, NSW, Australia; [Senina, Inna; Calmettes, Beatriz; Lehodey, Patrick] Collecte Localisat Satellite, Toulouse, France; [Adams, Timothy] Gonedau Fdn, Port Ouenghi, New Caledonia; [Aumont, Olivier; Lengaigne, Matthieu] Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, MNHN, LOCEANI PSL,IRD, Paris, France; [Clark, Sangaalofa] Parties Nauru Agreement Off, Majuro, Marshall Island; [Dessert, Morgane; Gorgues, Thomas] Univ Brest, CNRS, IRD, Ifremer Lab Oceanog Phys & Spatiale LOPS,IUEM, Brest, France; [Dessert, Morgane] Univ Bretagne Occidentale, Brest, France; [Gehlen, Marion] Univ Paris Saclay, LSCE IPSL, CEA, CNRS, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Hampton, John; Hare, Steven R.; Nicol, Simon; Pilling, Graham; Smith, Neville; Williams, Peter] Pacific Community SPC, Fisheries Aquaculture & Marine Ecosyst Div, Noumea, New Caledonia; [Holmes, Glen] Pew Charitable Trusts, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Lengaigne, Matthieu] Univ Montpellier, MARBEC, CNRS, Ifremer,IRD, Sete, France; [Mansfield, William] Paekakariki, Wellington, New Zealand; [Menkes, Christophe] Univ Nouvelle Caledonie, Univ Reunion, ENTROPIE, IRD,CNRS,Ifremer, Noumea, New Caledonia; [Nicol, Simon] Univ Canberra, Inst Appl Ecol, Ctr Conservat Ecol & Gen, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Ota, Yoshitaka] Univ Washington, Sch Marine & Environm Affairs, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Pasisi, Coral] Pacific Community SPC, Off Director Gen, Noumea, New Caledonia; [Reid, Chis] Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agcy, Honiara, Solomon Islands; [Ronneberg, Espen] Secretariat Pacific Reg Environm Programme, Apia, Samoa; [Sen Gupta, Alex] Univ NSW, Climate Change Res Ctr, Kensington, NSW, Australia; [Sen Gupta, Alex] Univ NSW, ARC Ctr Excellence Climate Extremes, Kensington, NSW, Australia; [Seto, Katherine L.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Environm Studies Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA",University of Wollongong; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ifremer; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Bretagne Occidentale; Institut Universitaire Europeen de la Mer (IUEM); Universite de Bretagne Occidentale; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Saclay; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ifremer; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; Ifremer; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Nouvelle Caledonie; University of Canberra; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of New South Wales Sydney; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz,"Bell, JD (corresponding author), Ctr Oceans Conservat Int, Arlington, VA 22230 USA.;Bell, JD (corresponding author), Univ Wollongong, Australian Natl Ctr Ocean Resources & Secur ANCOR, Wollongong, NSW, Australia.",jbell@conservation.org,"Gorgues, Thomas/G-4544-2010; menkes, christophe/H-9085-2016; Gupta, Alexander R Sen/B-7995-2011; Lengaigne, Matthieu/M-8321-2014; aumont, olivier/G-5207-2016","Gorgues, Thomas/0000-0003-0091-0314; menkes, christophe/0000-0002-1457-9696; Gupta, Alexander R Sen/0000-0001-5226-871X; Adams, Timothy/0000-0002-0164-7514; Hampton, William John/0000-0003-3006-8797; Hare, Steven/0000-0002-4021-6354; Nicol, Simon/0000-0001-8193-8719; Gehlen, Marion/0000-0002-9688-0692; Lengaigne, Matthieu/0000-0002-0044-036X; Hanich, Quentin/0000-0001-9402-6233; Senina, Inna/0000-0002-6614-9401; Lehodey, Patrick/0000-0002-2753-4796; aumont, olivier/0000-0003-3954-506X; Bell, Johann/0000-0003-2152-536X",Moccasin Lake Foundation; GEF; World Bank-implemented Ocean Partnerships for Sustainable Fisheries and Biodiversity Conservation; Common Oceans ABNJ Program by UN-FAO; European Union [820989]; Nippon Foundation Ocean Nexus Center at the University of Washington Earthlab,Moccasin Lake Foundation; GEF; World Bank-implemented Ocean Partnerships for Sustainable Fisheries and Biodiversity Conservation; Common Oceans ABNJ Program by UN-FAO; European Union(European Commission); Nippon Foundation Ocean Nexus Center at the University of Washington Earthlab,"This article is dedicated to our co-author Sue Taei, who lost her battle with cancer recently.

The current global river gauge network is biased towards large, perennial rivers, and strategic adaptations are needed to capture the full scope of rivers on Earth. Knowing where and when rivers flow is paramount to managing freshwater ecosystems. Yet stream gauging stations are distributed sparsely across rivers globally and may not capture the diversity of fluvial network properties and anthropogenic influences. Here we evaluate the placement bias of a global stream gauge dataset on its representation of socioecological, hydrologic, climatic and physiographic diversity of rivers. We find that gauges are located disproportionally in large, perennial rivers draining more human-occupied watersheds. Gauges are sparsely distributed in protected areas and rivers characterized by non-perennial flow regimes, both of which are critical to freshwater conservation and water security concerns. Disparities between the geography of the global gauging network and the broad diversity of streams and rivers weakens our ability to understand critical hydrologic processes and make informed water-management and policy decisions. Our findings underscore the need to address current gauge placement biases by investing in and prioritizing the installation of new gauging stations, embracing alternative water-monitoring strategies, advancing innovation in hydrologic modelling, and increasing accessibility of local and regional gauging data to support human responses to water challenges, both today and in the future.","[Krabbenhoft, Corey A.] Univ Buffalo, Dept Biol Sci & Res & Educ Energy, Environm & Water RENEW Inst, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; [Allen, George H.; Franklin, Catherin] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Geog, College Stn, TX USA; [Lin, Peirong] Peking Univ, Sch Earth & Space Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & GIS, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Godsey, Sarah E.] Idaho State Univ, Dept Geosci, Pocatello, ID 83209 USA; [Allen, Daniel C.] Penn State Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Burrows, Ryan M.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Ecosyst & Forest Sci, Burnley, Vic, Australia; [DelVecchia, Amanda G.] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC USA; [Fritz, Ken M.] US EPA, Off Res & Dev, Cincinnati, OH 45268 USA; [Shanafield, Margaret] Flinders Univ S Australia, Coll Sci & Engn, Natl Ctr Groundwater Res & Training, Bedford Pk, SA, Australia; [Burgin, Amy J.] Univ Kansas, Kansas Biol Survey, Ctr Ecol Res, Environm Studies Program, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Burgin, Amy J.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Zimmer, Margaret A.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Datry, Thibault] Ctr Lyon Grenoble Auvergne Rhone Alpes, UR Riverly, INRAE, Villeurbanne, France; [Dodds, Walter K.] Kansas State Univ, Div Biol, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Jones, C.

This study analyses air-quality-health-carbon interdependencies and costs of alternative heating options at the provincial level across northern China. The Chinese government accelerated the clean residential heating transition in northern China as part of a successful effort to improve regional air quality. Meanwhile, China has committed to carbon neutrality by 2060, making strategic choices for long-term decarbonization of the residential sector necessary. However, the synergies and trade-offs for health and carbon of alternative heating options and associated costs have not been systematically considered. Here we investigate air-quality-health-carbon interdependencies as well as household costs of using electricity (heat pumps or resistance heaters), gas or clean coal for residential heating for individual provinces across northern China. We find substantial air-quality and health benefits, varied carbon emissions and increased heating costs across clean heating options. With the 2015 power mix, gas heaters offer the largest health-carbon co-benefits, while resistance heaters lead to health-carbon trade-offs. As the power grid decarbonizes, by 2030 heat pumps achieve the largest health-carbon synergies of the options we analysed. Despite high capital costs, heat pumps generally have the lowest operating costs and thus are competitive for long-term use. With increased subsidies on the purchase of heat pumps, the government can facilitate further air-quality improvements and carbon mitigation in the clean heating transition.","[Zhou, Mi; Liu, Hongxun; Peng, Liqun; Mauzerall, Denise L.] Princeton Univ, Princeton Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Zhou, Mi; Zhang, Lin] Peking Univ, Sch Phys, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Lab Climate & Ocean Atmosphere Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Hongxun] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Qin, Yue] Peking Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Dan] China Meteorol Adm, Inst Urban Meteorol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Mauzerall, Denise L.] Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University; Peking University; Xi'an Jiaotong University; Peking University; China Meteorological Administration; Princeton University,"Mauzerall, DL (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Princeton Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.;Zhang, L (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Sch Phys, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Lab Climate & Ocean Atmosphere Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Mauzerall, DL (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",zhanglg@pku.edu.cn; mauzerall@princeton.edu,"Zhang, Lin/A-6729-2008; Chen, Dan/R-4486-2016; Mauzerall, Denise/I-5977-2013","Zhang, Lin/0000-0003-2383-8431; Chen, Dan/0000-0002-6317-0707; Qin, Yue/0000-0003-1664-4516; Zhou, Mi/0000-0001-8600-1503; Mauzerall, Denise/0000-0003-3479-1798","Ma Huateng Foundation grant; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41922037, 72173095]; China Scholarship Council [110, 5047]",Ma Huateng Foundation grant; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"We thank J.

Factors including cost, gender, career stage and geographic location were evaluated. Virtual conferences demonstrated a clearly discernable and, in some cases, orders of magnitude improvement across nearly all metrics. On the basis of participant survey results, this improvement may be attributed to a combination of reduced financial and personal-life burdens. However, despite this clear impact, further development of virtual networking features and poster sessions is necessary to achieve widespread adoption and acceptance of this new format. In-person conferences have typically resulted in a large carbon footprint while limiting inclusivity of those who can attend.

Here I estimate the global inequality of individual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions between 1990 and 2019 using a newly assembled dataset of income and wealth inequality, environmental input-output tables and a framework differentiating emissions from consumption and investments. In my benchmark estimates, I find that the bottom 50% of the world population emitted 12% of global emissions in 2019, whereas the top 10% emitted 48% of the total. Since 1990, the bottom 50% of the world population has been responsible for only 16% of all emissions, whereas the top 1% has been responsible for 23% of the total. While per-capita emissions of the global top 1% increased since 1990, emissions from low- and middle-income groups within rich countries declined. Contrary to the situation in 1990, 63% of the global inequality in individual emissions is now due to a gap between low and high emitters within countries rather than between countries. Finally, the bulk of total emissions from the global top 1% of the world population comes from their investments rather than from their consumption. These findings have implications for contemporary debates on fair climate policies and stress the need for governments to develop better data on individual emissions to monitor progress towards sustainable lifestyles. Understanding the connection between economic inequality and climate change requires rich and reliable data. This study combines recently assembled data on income and wealth inequality with environmental data to shed light on the uneven individual contributions to climate change across the world.","[Chancel, Lucas] Paris Sch Econ, World Inequal Lab, Paris, France",Paris School of Economics,"Chancel, L (corresponding author), Paris Sch Econ, World Inequal Lab, Paris, France.",lucas.chancel@psemail.eu,,,United Nations Development Program Grant [00093806]; European Research Council [856455],United Nations Development Program Grant; European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission),"I thank F.

Here, we present an overview of the latest published evidence, as well as the consensus of a diverse group of scientists and practitioners drawn from a structured analytical review and deliberative workshop process. We argue that resilience and well-being are related in complex ways, but in their applications in practice they are often assumed to be synergistic. Although theoretically compatible, evidence we present here shows that they may in fact work against each other. This has important implications for policy. Well-being and resilience are considered related or even synergistic dimensions of sustainable development. This Perspective highlights how trade-offs emerging from narrow interpretations of resilience and well-being could threaten sustainable development outcomes.","[Chaigneau, Tomas] Univ Exeter, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Penryn, England; [Coulthard, Sarah] Newcastle Univ, Sch Nat & Environm Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Daw, Tim M.; Reyers, Belinda] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm Resilience Ctr, Stockholm, Sweden; [Szaboova, Lucy] Univ Exeter, European Ctr Environm & Human Hlth, Truro, England; [Camfield, Laura] Univ East Anglia, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Chapin, F.

We argue that recent advances in AI for sustainable development, together with the need for a low-carbon recovery from the COVID-19 crisis, open a new window of opportunity for PCAs. Furthermore, we present design principles based on the Sustainable Development Goals for the future adoption of PCAs. We conclude that PCAs could be trialled in selected climate-conscious technologically advanced countries, mindful of potential issues around integration into the current policy mix, privacy concerns and distributional impacts. Personal carbon allowances (PCAs) could support climate mitigation efforts but would need to be carefully designed to avoid impacts on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

We applied a standardized method for assessing the risk of ecosystem collapse, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Ecosystems, to coral reefs in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO), covering 11,919 km(2) of reef (similar to 5% of the global total). Our approach combined indicators of change in historic ecosystem extent, ecosystem functioning (hard corals, fleshy algae, herbivores and piscivores) and projected sea temperature warming. We show that WIO coral reefs are vulnerable to collapse at the regional level, while in 11 nested ecoregions they range from critically endangered (islands, driven by future warming) to vulnerable (continental coast and northern Seychelles, driven principally by fishing pressure). Responses to avoid coral reef collapse must include ecosystem-based management of reefs and adjacent systems combined with mitigating and adapting to climate change. Our approach can be replicated across coral reefs globally to help countries and other actors meet conservation and sustainability targets set under multiple global conventions-including the Convention on Biological Diversity's post-2020 global biodiversity framework and the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.","[Obura, David; Gudka, Mishal; Samoilys, Melita; Osuka, Kennedy; Mbugua, James] CORDIO East Africa, Mombasa, Kenya; [Obura, David] IUCN Coral Specialist Grp, Mombasa, Kenya; [Samoilys, Melita] IUCN Grouper & Wrasse Specialist Grp, Mombasa, Kenya; [Keith, David A.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Porter, Sean] Oceanog Res Inst, Durban, South Africa; [Roche, Ronan] Bangor Univ, Ctr Appl Marine Sci, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales; [van Hooidonk, Ruben] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [van Hooidonk, Ruben] NOAA, Ocean Chem & Ecosyst Div, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL USA; [Ahamada, Said] AIDE, Moroni, Comoros; [Araman, Armindo] Adm Nacl Areas Conservacao ANAC, Maputo, Mozambique; [Karisa, Juliet] Kenya Marine & Fisheries Res Inst, Mombasa, Kenya; [Komakoma, John] Marine Parks & Reserves Unit MPRU, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Madi, Mouchtadi] Moheli Marine Pk, Nioumachoua, Comoros; [Ravinia, Isabelle] Seychelles Natl Parks Author, Victoria, Seychelles; [Razafindrainibe, Haja] Ctr Natl Rech Oceanog CNRO, Nosy Be, Madagascar; [Yahya, Saleh] Inst Marine Sci IMS, Zanzibar, Tanzania; [Zivane, Francisco] Natl Inst Fisheries Res, Maputo, Mozambique",University of New South Wales Sydney; Bangor University; University of Miami; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory (AOML),"Obura, D (corresponding author), CORDIO East Africa, Mombasa, Kenya.;Obura, D (corresponding author), IUCN Coral Specialist Grp, Mombasa, Kenya.",dobura@cordioea.net,"; van Hooidonk, Ruben/F-7395-2010","Obura, David/0000-0003-2256-6649; Osuka, Kennedy/0000-0001-7940-5411; van Hooidonk, Ruben/0000-0002-3804-1233; YAHYA, SALEH/0000-0002-5975-9957; Roche, Ronan/0000-0002-6342-9571",Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD),Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD),"We thank contributors in the Western Indian Ocean GCRMN for access to data for this study and the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems Unit for initial training and scoping.

However, appropriate monitoring is still lacking. We estimate global key environmental footprints (FPs) of the German BE in a historic analysis from 2000-2015 and in projection until 2030. Overall, the agricultural biomass FP is dominated by animal-based food consumption, which is slightly decreasing. The forestry biomass FP of consumption could potentially shift from net import to total supply from domestic territory. Agricultural land use for consumption is triple that of domestic agricultural land (which covers half of Germany) and induced substantial land use change in other regions from 2000-2015. The FP of irrigation water withdrawals has decreased over 2000-2015 and might continue to decline in absolute terms by 2030, but the share of supply regions with water stress might increase. The climate FP of BE contributes 18-20% to the total climate FP of domestic consumption, while employment makes up 10% and value added only 8% of the total German economy. These findings imply that sufficient monitoring of the BE needs to consider both production and consumption perspectives, as well as global FPs of national economies. An analysis of the German bioeconomy between 2000 and 2015 finds that its environmental footprints are dominated by animal-based food consumption, and agricultural land use for consumption abroad is double the domestic one.","[Bringezu, Stefan; Wimmer, Florian; Schaldach, Ruediger; Egenolf, Vincent] Univ Kassel, Ctr Environm Syst Res, Kassel, Germany; [Distelkamp, Martin; Lutz, Christian] Inst Econ Struct Res GWS, Osnabruck, Germany; [Hennenberg, Klaus Josef; Boettcher, Hannes] Oko Inst, Darmstadt, Germany",Universitat Kassel,"Bringezu, S (corresponding author), Univ Kassel, Ctr Environm Syst Res, Kassel, Germany.",bringezu@uni-kassel.de,"Lutz, Christian/AAA-3299-2022","Bottcher, Hannes/0000-0001-8238-3006; Egenolf, Vincent/0000-0002-5401-9378; Lutz, Christian/0000-0001-8849-8197; Hennenberg, Klaus Josef/0000-0001-7927-2356",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [031 B0281A],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),This work was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the framework of the SYMOBIO project (number 031 B0281A).,,60,15,15,5,37,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2398-9629,,,NAT SUSTAIN,Nat.

The Great Green Wall programme is a colossal initiative to restore 100 million hectares of degraded ecosystems across 11 countries in the region, which started in 2007 to also promote sustainable development and climate change mitigation. We evaluated the economic costs and benefits of future land restoration projects under this programme. We applied different scenarios that account for both market-priced and non-market benefits from restored ecosystems and consider the heterogeneity of local decision-making contexts in terms of investment planning horizons, discount rates, and the time needed for the restored ecosystems to start yielding their benefits in full. The results show that every US dollar invested into land restoration yields on average US$1.2 under the base scenario, ranging from US$1.1 to US$4.4 across the scenarios. At most, ten years are needed for land restoration activities to break even from the social perspective, accounting for both market-priced and non-market ecosystem benefits. To fund all proposed land restoration activities, an investment of US$44 billion is needed under the base scenario (US$18-70 billion across scenarios). Violent conflicts in the Sahel are estimated to reduce the accessibility to these degraded ecosystems from 27.9 million hectares to 14.1 million hectares. The study highlights activities and locations where land restoration is both economically attractive and ecologically sustainable, even after accounting for lower survival rates of planted trees and grasses, persistence of land degradation drivers and the growing number of violent conflicts hindering land restoration in the Sahel. This information can help improve the targeting of future land restoration activities in the region. A cost-benefit analysis of land restoration in the African Great Green Wall shows that, under a range of assumptions, the investment makes economic sense at a regional level, despite the differences across countries and biomes.","[Mirzabaev, A.; Motlagh, F.; Shyrokaya, A.] Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, Bonn, Germany; [Sacande, M.; Martucci, A.] Food & Agr Org United Nations FAO, Rome, Italy",University of Bonn; Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),"Mirzabaev, A (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, Bonn, Germany.",almir@uni-bonn.de,"Shyrokaya, Anastasiya/AAD-6107-2022","Shyrokaya, Anastasiya/0000-0002-0492-7407; Motlagh, Farinaz/0000-0002-3884-7835; Mirzabaev, Alisher/0000-0002-5223-7160",Pan-African and National agencies of the Great Green Wall; European Union [GCP/INT/157/EC],Pan-African and National agencies of the Great Green Wall; European Union(European Commission),"The collaboration and support of the Pan-African and National agencies of the Great Green Wall are acknowledged.

This study finds that although unlimited irrigation could increase BECCS potential by 60-71% by 2100, doing so sustainably would increase it by only 5-6%. Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is crucial in many stringent climate scenarios. Although irrigation can enhance BECCS potential, where and to what extent it can enhance global BECCS potential are unknown when constrained by preventing additional water stress and suppressing withdrawal of nonrenewable water resources. With a spatially explicit representation of bioenergy crop plantations and water cycle in an internally consistent model framework, we identified the irrigable bioenergy cropland on the basis of the water resources reserve. Irrigation of such cropland enhanced BECCS potential by only 5-6% (<60-71% for unconstrained irrigation) above the rain-fed potential (0.82-1.99 Gt C yr(-1)) by the end of this century. Nonetheless, it limited additional water withdrawal (166-298 km(3) yr(-1)), especially from nonrenewable water sources (16-20%), compared with unconstrained irrigation (1,392-3,929 km(3) yr(-1) and 73-78%).

Across 3,100 km of US coastline, the top-most 1 m of coral reefs prevents the 100-yr flood from growing by 23% (113 km(2)), avoiding flooding to 53,800 (62%) people, US$2.7 billion (90%) damage to buildings and US$2.6 billion (49%) in indirect economic effects.

We develop and apply a method that combines SDG interaction analysis, which helps determine prerequisites for SDG attainment, with the transition management framework, which helps align policy goals with institutional designs. Using Aruba as a case study, we show that prioritizing increased economic benefits from sustainable marine development, including those of tourism, provides the greatest amount of direct co-benefits to other SDGs. When considering indirect co-benefits, reducing marine pollution emerged as a key supporting target to achieve SDGs. The results also show that, as in many other small island states, sustainable ocean development in Aruba depends on international partnerships to address global issues-including climate change mitigation-over which it has little control. Using SDG relationships as a guide for institutional cooperation, we find that the institutions with the most potential to coordinate action for sustainable ocean development are those that address economic, social and international policy, rather than institutions specifically focused on environmental policy. Our results provide key methodologies and insights for sustainable marine development that require coordinated actions across institutions. Cooperative institutional networks are essential to achieve SDG targets.

This study finds large yield gaps among large and smallholder farms there, suggesting improved management could increase production while sparing fragile ecosystems. Oil palm production in Indonesia illustrates the intense pressure that exists worldwide to convert natural ecosystems to agricultural production. Oil palm production has increased because of expansion of cultivated area rather than due to average-yield increases. We used a data-rich modelling approach to investigate how intensification on existing plantations could help Indonesia meet palm oil demand while preserving fragile ecosystems. We found that average current yield represents 62% and 53% of the attainable yield in large and smallholder plantations, respectively. Narrowing yield gaps via improved agronomic management, together with a limited expansion that excludes fragile ecosystems, would save 2.6 million hectares of forests and peatlands and avoid 732 MtCO(2)e compared with following historical trends in yield and land use. Fine-tuning policy to promote intensification, along with investments in agricultural research and development, can help reconcile economic and environmental goals.","[Monzon, Juan P.; Andrade, Jose F.; Couedel, Antoine; Rattalino Edreira, Juan I.; Donough, Christopher R.; Sugianto, Hendra; Li Lim, Ya; Farrell, Thomas; Grassini, Patricio] Univ Nebraska, Dept Agron & Hort, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [Monzon, Juan P.] Natl Sci & Tech Res Council CONICET, Balcarce, Argentina; [Slingerland, Maja A.; Hekman, Willem; van den Beuken, Rob] Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Rahutomo, Suroso; Hidayat, Fandi; Pradiko, Iput] Indonesian Oil Palm Res Inst IOPRI, Medan, Indonesia; [Agus, Fahmuddin; Purwantomo, Dwi K.

While PES has been found to produce some ecological and livelihood benefits, an understudied concern is what happens when payments stop. We assess how households' land-use behaviours changed in response to a temporary gap in payments and subsequent payment uncertainty in a programme in Ecuador, which paid communities to reduce their grazing on their communal lands. In 2015, after six years in operation, the programme lost funds and stopped payments. These resumed in 2017, but participants were only partially repaid retroactively, and future payments remained uncertain due to funding instability. Using a difference-in-difference modelling approach, we compare household grazing behaviour between communities in the programme and a set of control communities over ten years before PES payments, during PES payments and after the gap in payments in a period where participants were still owed at least one past payment and future payments were uncertain (n = 871 households). We find that grazing was significantly reduced by almost 20% over the ten-year period and that households continued to refrain from grazing even after experiencing payment loss. Our results demonstrate the importance of aligning programme objectives with community conservation and livelihood goals. Our discussion suggests how these conditions may interact with PES to prompt sustained behavioural change.

Meanwhile, meeting climate goals without global net-negative emissions inevitably needs early and rapid emission reduction measures, which also brings challenges in the near term. Here we identify the implications for land-use and food systems of scenarios that do not depend on land-based CDR technologies. We find that early climate action has multiple benefits and trade-offs, and avoids the need for drastic (mitigation-induced) shifts in land use in the long term. Further long-term benefits are lower food prices, reduced risk of hunger and lower demand for irrigation water. Simultaneously, however, near-term mitigation pressures in the agriculture, forest and land-use sector and the required land area for energy crops increase, resulting in additional risk of food insecurity. Delaying climate mitigation requires large-scale carbon dioxide removal (CDR) in the second half of this century, with possible adverse effects. Under scenarios with no dependence on CDR technologies, this study examines the short- and long-term implications of climate mitigation for land-use and food systems.","[Hasegawa, Tomoko] Ritsumeikan Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Kusatsu, Japan; [Hasegawa, Tomoko; Fujimori, Shinichiro] Natl Inst Environm Studies NIES, Ctr Social & Environm Syst Res, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Fujimori, Shinichiro; Oshiro, Ken] Kyoto Univ, Dept Environm Engn, Kyoto, Japan; [Fujimori, Shinichiro; Frank, Stefan; Gusti, Mykola; van Ruijven, Bas; Cabardos, Anique-Marie; Deppermann, Andre; Havlik, Petr; Krey, Volker; Riahi, Keywan] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal IIASA, Laxenburg, Austria; [Humpenoeder, Florian; Bertram, Christoph] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Potsdam, Germany; [Despres, Jacques; Keramidas, Kimon] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr JRC, Seville, Spain; [Drouet, Laurent; Emmerling, Johannes] Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climatici, RFF CMCC European Inst Econ & Environm, Milan, Italy; [Gusti, Mykola] Lviv Polytech Natl Univ, Lvov, Ukraine; [Harmsen, Mathijs; van Vuuren, Detlef] PBL Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, The Hague, Netherlands; [Harmsen, Mathijs; van Vuuren, Detlef] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Ochi, Yuki] E Konzal Co Ltd, Yodogawa, Osaka, Japan; [Rochedo, Pedro; Schaeffer, Roberto] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro UFRJ, Ctr Energy & Environm Econ CENERGIA COPPE, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Riahi, Keywan] Graz Univ Technol, Graz, Austria",Ritsumeikan University; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; Kyoto University; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Lviv Polytechnic National University; Utrecht University; Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; Graz University of Technology,"Hasegawa, T (corresponding author), Ritsumeikan Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Kusatsu, Japan.;Hasegawa, T (corresponding author), Natl Inst Environm Studies NIES, Ctr Social & Environm Syst Res, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.",thase@fc.ritsumei.ac.jp,"Humpenöder, Florian/HHN-1081-2022; Popp, Alexander/N-7064-2014; Oshiro, Ken/W-9746-2018; Krey, Volker/ABD-5070-2021; Drouet, Laurent/J-9894-2019; Schaeffer, Roberto/F-9262-2012; Fujimori, Shinichiro/A-1288-2015; Gusti, Mykola/D-4818-2018; Frank, Stefan/AAE-8070-2019; Hasegawa, Tomoko/AAB-2616-2019; van Ruijven, Bas/G-8106-2011; van Vuuren, Detlef/A-4764-2009","Humpenöder, Florian/0000-0003-2927-9407; Popp, Alexander/0000-0001-9500-1986; Oshiro, Ken/0000-0001-6720-409X; Drouet, Laurent/0000-0002-4087-7662; Schaeffer, Roberto/0000-0002-3709-7323; Fujimori, Shinichiro/0000-0001-7897-1796; Gusti, Mykola/0000-0002-2576-9217; Frank, Stefan/0000-0001-5702-8547; Hasegawa, Tomoko/0000-0003-2456-5789; van Ruijven, Bas/0000-0003-1232-5892; Bertram, Christoph/0000-0002-0933-4395; EMMERLING, Johannes/0000-0003-0916-9913; van Vuuren, Detlef/0000-0003-0398-2831; Despres, Jacques/0000-0002-9851-9964","Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan [JPMEERF20202002, JPMEERF20211001]; Sumitomo Foundation; Ritsumeikan Global Innovation Research Organization (R-GIRO), Ritsumeikan University; Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq); European Union [821471]","Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan; Sumitomo Foundation; Ritsumeikan Global Innovation Research Organization (R-GIRO), Ritsumeikan University; Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); European Union(European Commission)","T.H., S.

While annual streamflow trends are driven predominantly by climate, human activity works to both amplify and dampen the seasonal trends of managed streamflows across North America. While it is established that climate change and human activities (for example, urbanization, dams) alter streamflows, there exists considerable uncertainty regarding the relative magnitude of their contributions. Most studies have focused on annual flows and found trends to be dominated by climate. Here we compare trends in seasonal flow totals for 315 natural and 1,957 managed watersheds across North America over 60 years (1950-2009). We find an amplification of seasonal flow trends in 44% of the managed watersheds, while 48% of the watersheds exhibit flow dampening. The magnitudes of amplification (20-167%) and dampening (5-52%) are substantial and vary seasonally. Multivariate models reveal that while rainfall, slope and forest cover are the key drivers of seasonal trends in natural watersheds, canals, impervious areas and dam storage dominate the responses in managed watersheds. Our findings of human-driven seasonal flow alterations highlight the need to develop adaptation strategies that mitigate the associated negative impacts.","[Singh, Nitin K.; Basu, Nandita B.] Univ Waterloo, Earth & Environm Sci, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Basu, Nandita B.] Univ Waterloo, Civil & Environm Engn, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Basu, Nandita B.] Univ Waterloo, Water Inst, Waterloo, ON, Canada",University of Waterloo; University of Waterloo; University of Waterloo,"Singh, NK (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Earth & Environm Sci, Waterloo, ON, Canada.",nksingh01@gmail.com,"Singh, Nitin/AAO-6026-2020","Singh, Nitin/0000-0002-8495-1908; B.

Understanding how health risks are coproduced by local climatic variability, place and social inequities is vital for improving decision-making, particularly in decentralized contexts. We assess the impacts of rainfall variability and multiscale vulnerabilities on birth weight, which has lifelong health consequences. We focus on highly river-dependent areas in Amazonia, using urban and rural birth registrations during 2006-2017. We find a strong but spatially differentiated relationship between local rainfall and subsequent river-level anomalies. Using Bayesian models, we disentangle the impacts of rainfall shocks of different magnitudes, municipal characteristics, social inequities and seasonality. Prenatal exposure to extremely intense rainfall is associated with preterm birth, restricted intra-uterine growth and lower mean birth weight (<=-183 g). Adverse birth outcomes also follow non-extreme intense rainfall (40% higher odds of low birth weight), drier conditions than seasonal averages (-39 g mean birth weight) and conception in the rising-water season (-13 g mean birth weight). Babies experience penalties totalling 646 g when born to adolescent, Amerindian, unmarried mothers that received no formal education or antenatal or obstetric health care. Rainfall variability confers intergenerational disadvantage, especially for socially marginalized Amazonians in forgotten places. Structural changes are required to reduce inequities, foster citizen empowerment and improve the social accountability of public institutions. Amazonians are subject to climate shocks, but the associated health outcomes are still unclear. This study finds that rainfall variability is associated with adverse birth outcomes, especially for those most isolated and marginalized.","[Chacon-Montalvan, Erick A.] Univ Lancaster, Dept Math & Stat, Lancaster, England; [Taylor, Benjamin M.] Blackpool Teaching Hosp NHS Fdn, Blackpool, England; [Cunha, Marcelo G.] Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Escola Nacl Saude Publ, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Davies, Gemma; Parry, Luke] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster Environm Ctr, Lancaster, England; [Orellana, Jesem D.

This study surveyed water managers across the United States to assess how knowledge is formed and disseminated, or how it is not. Inland freshwater harmful algal blooms are a growing threat to drinking water worldwide. Here we present the results of a national survey of how drinking water managers experience and perceive both nuisance harmful algal blooms and toxic harmful algal blooms (TABs) (N = 335) in the United States. We find that previous experience with harmful algal blooms increases drinking water systems' planning and preparation. However, unexpectedly, we also find that (1) water managers who experienced TABs rate them as more difficult to manage than do those with no previous TAB experience, and (2) managers in systems that experience TABs become increasingly reliant on internal resources to respond to TABs once they occur rather than reaching out for external sources of information and technology. This turn towards self-reliance could make the effective dissemination of state-of-the-art information and solutions more difficult among water systems and further isolate some vulnerable systems.","[Treuer, Galen; Kirchhoff, Christine] Univ Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Lemos, Maria Carmen; McGrath, Francesca] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [McGrath, Francesca] Arcadia Fund, London, England",University of Connecticut; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Treuer, G (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",gtreuer@gmail.com,,"Lemos, Maria Carmen/0000-0001-6686-730X; Kirchhoff, Christine/0000-0002-2686-6764",National Science Foundation [OCE-1600012],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),This research was supported by the National Science Foundation award no.

This paper focuses on eight key countries in developing Asia (Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Philippines, Thailand, Turkey and Vietnam). By combining national household surveys with input-output data, we compare the distributional effects of four carbon pricing design options, including a globally harmonized carbon price, a national carbon price and sectoral carbon prices in the power and transport sectors, respectively. Our analysis reveals a substantial degree of variation regarding who would be affected across policy designs and countries. Looking into national carbon pricing as the most favourable policy option from an economic point of view, we find that differences in distributional outcomes are generally more pronounced within income groups than across income groups. These differences are mainly driven by households' energy use patterns, which vary across countries. Equally recycling revenues back to all citizens would overcompensate the burden of a carbon price for the poorest households in all countries. Carbon pricing can alter income distribution. With a focus on Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Philippines, Thailand, Turkey and Vietnam, this study compares four types of carbon pricing schemes and finds substantial variation in distributional effects across policy designs and countries.","[Steckel, Jan C.; Dorband, Ira I.; Montrone, Lorenzo; Ward, Hauke; Missbach, Leonard; Hafner, Fabian; Jakob, Michael; Renner, Sebastian] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Berlin, Germany; [Dorband, Ira I.; Montrone, Lorenzo; Missbach, Leonard] Tech Univ Berlin, Dept Econ Climate Change, Berlin, Germany; [Ward, Hauke] Leiden Univ, Inst Environm Sci CML, Dept Ind Ecol, Leiden, Netherlands; [Renner, Sebastian] German Inst Global & Area Studies GIGA, Hamburg, Germany",Technical University of Berlin; Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; German Institute of Global & Area Studies,"Steckel, JC (corresponding author), Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Berlin, Germany.",steckel@mcc-berlin.net,"; Jakob, Michael/I-7320-2015","Steckel, Jan Christoph/0000-0002-5325-9214; Jakob, Michael/0000-0001-5005-3563","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [01LS10A, pep1p5]; Volkswagen Foundation (CoCCCo); German Federal Environmental Foundation; Heinrich Boll Foundation; GIZ [81250748]",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Volkswagen Foundation (CoCCCo); German Federal Environmental Foundation; Heinrich Boll Foundation; GIZ,"We thank participants of the 2019 annual conference of the Environment for Development Network and the EAERE 25 postconference workshop on 'The Economics of Inequality and the Environment', as well as L.

Universities provide pathways to sustainability careers and help diversify the field by making programmes more equitable and inclusive for racially minoritized students. Toward this end, we interviewed undergraduate BIPOC students in interdisciplinary environmental and sustainability degree programmes about their experiences. Their observations reflect a legacy of systemic racism that persists today within environmentalism. Many described motivations connecting ecological and social well-being but lamented limited interdisciplinary and global perspectives in the curriculum. Experiences of discrimination, lack of relatability and limited discussions of race led to feeling isolated and excluded. Support networks, extracurricular participation and BIPOC-specific opportunities improved student inclusion and belonging. BIPOC students hold knowledge unapparent to non-marginalized groups that illuminates pathways to racial equity in environmental sustainability.

As a result, they often fall into poverty traps, a problem likely to worsen as the frequency of weather disasters increases due to climate change. Insurance offers, in principle, a solution for this conundrum and a means to guarantee households' wellbeing. Group collective index insurance constitutes an alternative to indemnity or individual index insurance, and has the potential to alleviate basis risk through within-group informal transfers. Here we show that collective index insurance introduces a coordination dilemma of insurance adoption: socially optimal outcomes are obtained when everyone adopts insurance; however, a minimum fraction of contributors is necessary before the effects of basis risk can be averaged out and individuals start taking up insurance. We further show that additional mechanisms-such as local peer monitoring and defector exclusion-are necessary to stabilize informal transfers and collective index insurance adoption. Together, collective index insurance and informal transfers may thus constitute a practical instrument to improve sustainability in developing countries. Insurance for a group that reduces risks with informal within-group transfers and local peer monitoring can help low-income farmers alleviate poverty aggravated by extreme weather.","[Santos, Fernando P.; Levin, Simon A.] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Santos, Fernando P.; Levin, Simon A.] Princeton Univ, Ctr BioComplex, Princeton Environm Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Pacheco, Jorge M.] Univ Minho, CBMA, Braga, Portugal; [Pacheco, Jorge M.] Univ Minho, Dept Matemat & Aplicacoes, Braga, Portugal; [Pacheco, Jorge M.; Santos, Francisco C.] IST Taguspk, ATP Grp, Porto Salvo, Portugal; [Santos, Francisco C.] Univ Lisbon, IST Taguspk, INESC ID, Porto Salvo, Portugal; [Santos, Francisco C.] Univ Lisbon, IST Taguspk, Inst Super Tecn, Porto Salvo, Portugal; [Levin, Simon A.] Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Levin, Simon A.] Beijer Inst Ecol Econ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Levin, Simon A.] Princeton Univ, Andlinger Ctr Energy & Environm, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University; Princeton University; Universidade do Minho; Universidade do Minho; INESC-ID; Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico; Resources for the Future; Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences; Beijer Institute of Ecological Economics; Princeton University,"Santos, FP; Levin, SA (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.;Santos, FP; Levin, SA (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Ctr BioComplex, Princeton Environm Inst, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.;Levin, SA (corresponding author), Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC 20036 USA.;Levin, SA (corresponding author), Beijer Inst Ecol Econ, Stockholm, Sweden.;Levin, SA (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Andlinger Ctr Energy & Environm, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",fppdsantos@gmail.com; slevin@princeton.edu,"Levin, Simon A/J-1218-2014; Santos, Francisco C./D-2394-2010; Santos, Fernando P./AAA-7581-2021; Santos, Fernando/R-5609-2017; Pacheco, Jorge M./B-6116-2008","Levin, Simon A/0000-0002-8216-5639; Santos, Francisco C./0000-0002-9103-2862; Santos, Fernando/0000-0002-2310-6444; Pacheco, Jorge M./0000-0002-2579-8499","James S.

This study assesses the potential of intensification-increasing yields on a given area-to produce more soybean in Brazil without further Amazon forest loss and to reduce existing CO2 emissions. The Amazon basin includes 550 Mha covered with rainforests, and 60% of this area is in Brazil. The conversion of rainforest for soybean production raises concerns about how Brazil can reconcile production and environmental goals. Here we investigated the degree to which intensification could help Brazil produce more soybean without further encroachment on the Amazon forest. Our analysis shows that the continuation of current trends in soybean yield and area would lead to the conversion of an additional 5.7 Mha of forests and savannahs during the next 15 years, with an associated 1,955 Mt of CO(2)e released into the atmosphere. In contrast, the acceleration of yield improvement, coupled with the expansion of soybean area only in areas currently used for livestock production, would allow Brazil to produce 162 Mt of soybean without deforestation and with 58% lower global climate warming relative to that derived from the continuation of current trends.","[Marin, Fabio R.; Silva, Evandro H.

Methanotrophic bacteria can transform this methane into useful protein-rich biomass, already approved for inclusion into animal feed. In the rapidly growing aquaculture industry, methanotrophic additives have a favourable amino acid profile and can offset ocean-caught fishmeal, reducing demands on over-harvested fisheries. Here we analyse the economic potential of producing methanotrophic microbial protein from stranded methane produced at wastewater treatment plants, landfills, and oil and gas facilities. Our results show that current technology can enable production, in the United States alone, equivalent to 14% of the global fishmeal market at prices at or below the current cost of fishmeal (roughly US$1,600 per metric ton). A sensitivity analysis highlights technically and economically feasible cost reductions (such as reduced cooling or labour requirements), which could allow stranded methane from the United States alone to satisfy global fishmeal demand. Methanotrophic bacteria can capture waste greenhouse gas emissions and feed fish, reducing the need for wild captures. An economic analysis shows great potential for this approach to replace aquaculture feed at competitive prices.","[El Abbadi, Sahar H.; Criddle, Craig S.] Stanford Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Sherwin, Evan D.; Brandt, Adam R.] Stanford Univ, Dept Energy Resources Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Luby, Stephen P.] Stanford Univ, Infect Dis & Geog Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Luby, Stephen P.; Criddle, Craig S.] Stanford Univ, Stanford Woods Inst Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University; Stanford University; Stanford University; Stanford University,"Criddle, CS (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;Criddle, CS (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Stanford Woods Inst Environm, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",criddle@stanford.edu,"Brandt, Adam R/H-1363-2013","El Abbadi, Sahar/0000-0003-2500-553X; Sherwin, Evan/0000-0003-2180-4297; Luby, Stephen/0000-0001-5385-899X; Criddle, Craig/0000-0002-2750-8547",Stanford Center for Innovation in Global Health; Stanford Natural Gas Initiative,Stanford Center for Innovation in Global Health; Stanford Natural Gas Initiative,"This study was funded by the Stanford Center for Innovation in Global Health (S.H.E., C.S.C. and S.P.L.) and the Stanford Natural Gas Initiative (S.H.E., E.D.S., C.S.C. and A.R.B.), an industry consortium that supports independent research at Stanford University.

This study presents an integrated model for understanding the role of human-natural systems interactions in climate change. The redesign of energy and economic systems to stabilize climate change is hindered by the lack of quantitative treatment of the role that human-natural systems interactions play in what society can do to tackle climate change. Here we present an integrated socio-energy-ecologic-climate model framework for understanding the role of human-natural systems interactions in climate change. We focus on constraints on climate stabilization imposed by feedbacks between global warming and societal actions to decarbonize energy use and to scale up atmospheric-carbon extraction. The energy-climate feedbacks are modelled through four warming-dependent response times for societal, policy and technological actions inferred from historical data. We show that a lack of societal response beyond 2030 would result in a warming in excess of 3 degrees C. Speeding up societal response times and technology diffusion times by a factor of two along with a dramatic boost in start-up investment in renewables and atmospheric-carbon extraction technologies and short-lived climate pollutants mitigation by 2030 can stabilize the warming below 1.5 degrees C. The model's analytical framework and the analyses presented here reveal the fundamental importance of factoring in the role of human-natural systems interactions in the transition to zero emissions when formulating and designing robust climate solutions.","[Ramanathan, Veerabhadran; Versaci, Anthony] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, San Diego, CA 92103 USA; [Xu, Yangyang] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Coll Geosci, College Stn, TX 77834 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Ramanathan, V (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, San Diego, CA 92103 USA.;Xu, YY (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Coll Geosci, College Stn, TX 77834 USA.",vramanathan@ucsd.edu; yangyang.xu@tamu.edu,"Xu, Yangyang/I-1930-2018","Xu, Yangyang/0000-0001-7173-7761",Edward A.

The challenge is to filter unclear or conflicting signals from various climatic and socio-economic variables and link them to food security outcomes. Integrating lag-1 autocorrelation diagnostics into remotely sensed observations from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission and food prices, we found dramatic improvement in anticipating the timing and intensity of food crises, except in conflict settings. We analysed drought-induced food crises globally in the SMAP record (since 2015; approximately five per year). The change in soil moisture autocorrelation, which we term the Soil Moisture Auto-Regressive Threshold (SMART), signalled an accurate food security transition for all cases studied here (P < 0.05; n = 212), including lead time of up to three to six months for every case. The SMART trigger anticipates the timing of the transition and the magnitude of the food security change among small to large transitions, both into and out of crises (R-2 = 0.80-0.83). While we do not evaluate out-of-sample forecast accuracy using our model, our findings suggest a significant advancement in the capabilities of food security early-warning diagnostics and could save lives and resources. Early warnings of impending food crises can provide valuable time to mitigate their worst impacts, but droughts have proven difficult to predict. Soil moisture autocorrelation measured by remote sensing satellites advances our ability to anticipate food security crises resulting from drought.","[Krishnamurthy, P.

Why do we hear calls to separate and independently manage aspects of risk and resilience that are inherently related? These arguments are inconsistent with more holistic and integrated responses to wicked challenges-such as climate change-that are necessary if we are to find balances and synergies. The justification of such views is based on misconceptions of risk science that are no longer accurate. Rather than being irrelevant, the risk concept and related literature provide a wealth of resilience analysis resources that are potentially being overlooked. In this Perspective, we discuss how the modern view of risk can provide an integrated framework for the key aspects of resilience.","[Logan, Tom McLeod] Univ Canterbury, Cluster Community & Urban Resilience, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Logan, Tom McLeod] Univ Canterbury, Dept Civil & Nat Resources Engn, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Aven, Terje; Flage, Roger] Univ Stavanger, Dept Safety Econ & Planning, Ctr Risk Management & Societal Safety, Stavanger, Norway; [Guikema, Seth David] Univ Michigan, Ind & Operat Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Canterbury; University of Canterbury; Universitetet i Stavanger; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Logan, TM (corresponding author), Univ Canterbury, Cluster Community & Urban Resilience, Christchurch, New Zealand.;Logan, TM (corresponding author), Univ Canterbury, Dept Civil & Nat Resources Engn, Christchurch, New Zealand.",tom.logan@canterbury.ac.nz,,"Flage, Roger/0000-0002-2967-9104; Logan, Thomas/0000-0002-9209-3018",,,,,54,4,4,11,33,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2398-9629,,,NAT SUSTAIN,Nat.

Development agencies have invested heavily in sustainable land management projects to overturn land productivity losses, but efforts to assess project impacts have been hampered by operational issues and by the high costs of gathering on-ground data. This study combines satellite observations (moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer-based Enhanced Vegetation Index and Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2-derived solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence-based gross primary production) with quasi-experimental impact evaluation methods to examine the impacts of the Sustainable Land Management Project in Ethiopia, one of the world's most ambitious restoration efforts to date. We find that over a five-year effective implementation period, gross primary production in treated locations grew by 13.5% on average in areas affected by severe droughts (those with a standard precipitation index lower than -2) and by 3.1% in areas that did not experience droughts, suggesting important drought-buffering effects. We provide empirical evidence about the effectiveness of sustainable land management projects in restoring land productivity and resilience to weather shocks, and show that remote-sensing technologies can be incorporated into impact evaluation models to assess ecosystem restoration programmes. Assessing the effectiveness of restoration projects faces challenges due to operational issues and the high costs of gathering on-ground data. This study combines satellite observations with quasi-experimental methods to examine the impacts of the Sustainable Land Management Project in Ethiopia.","[Constenla-Villoslada, Susana; Liu, Yanyan] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Wen, Jiaming; Sun, Ying] Cornell Univ, Soil & Crop Sci Sect, Sch Integrat Plant Sci, Ithaca, NY USA; [Chonabayashi, Shun] Soka Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Cornell University; Soka University,"Liu, YY (corresponding author), Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",y.liu@cgiar.org,"Sun, Ying/G-6611-2016","Constenla-Villoslada, Susana/0000-0001-7736-8725; Chonabayashi, Shun/0000-0003-2961-7234; Sun, Ying/0000-0002-9819-1241","PROFOR; World Bank [TF0B1259]; CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM); NASA CMS [80NSSC21K1058]","PROFOR; World Bank(The World Bank India); CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM)(CGIAR); NASA CMS","For feedback and insights on earlier drafts of this work, we thank M.

While planning models have long been used to inform investments in water infrastructure, they frequently overlook interacting risks, impacts on the poor and local context. We address this gap by developing and applying a stochastic-optimization model to simulate the impact of flood embankment investments on the distribution of agricultural incomes across income groups for six diverse polders (embanked areas) in coastal Bangladesh. Results show that increasing salinity and waterlogging negate the benefits of embankment rehabilitation in improving agricultural production while improved drainage can alleviate these impacts. Outcomes vary across income groups, with risks of crop loss being greatest for the poor. We discuss the need for planning models to consider the interacting benefits and risks of infrastructure investments within a local political economy to better inform coastal adaptation decisions. People living in Bangladesh's coastal zone face multiple water-related risks. This modelling study finds that rising salinity and waterlogging negate the benefits of rehabilitating embankments for reducing crop loss, with impacts being greatest for the poor. Drainage was found to reduce negative impacts.","[Barbour, Emily J.; Adnan, Mohammed Sarfaraz Gani; Borgomeo, Edoardo; Hall, Jim W.] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Barbour, Emily J.] CSIRO, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Adnan, Mohammed Sarfaraz Gani] Chittagong Univ Engn & Technol, Chattogram, Bangladesh; [Paprocki, Kasia] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England; [Khan, M.
