Ambitious tree-planting initiatives, many already underway, aim to sequester enormous quantities of carbon to partly compensate for anthropogenic CO2 emissions, which are a major cause of rising global temperatures. However, tree planting that is poorly planned and executed could actually increase CO2 emissions and have long-term, deleterious impacts on biodiversity, landscapes and livelihoods. Here, we highlight the main environmental risks of large-scale tree planting and propose 10 golden rules, based on some of the most recent ecological research, to implement forest ecosystem restoration that maximizes rates of both carbon sequestration and biodiversity recovery while improving livelihoods. These are as follows: (1) Protect existing forest first; (2) Work together (involving all stakeholders); (3) Aim to maximize biodiversity recovery to meet multiple goals; (4) Select appropriate areas for restoration; (5) Use natural regeneration wherever possible; (6) Select species to maximize biodiversity; (7) Use resilient plant material (with appropriate genetic variability and provenance); (8) Plan ahead for infrastructure, capacity and seed supply; (9) Learn by doing (using an adaptive management approach); and (10) Make it pay (ensuring the economic sustainability of the project). We focus on the design of long-term strategies to tackle the climate and biodiversity crises and support livelihood needs. We emphasize the role of local communities as sources of indigenous knowledge, and the benefits they could derive from successful reforestation that restores ecosystem functioning and delivers a diverse range of forest products and services. While there is no simple and universal recipe for forest restoration, it is crucial to build upon the currently growing public and private interest in this topic, to ensure interventions provide effective, long-term carbon sinks and maximize benefits for biodiversity and people.

Yet, the impacts of increasing the diversity of cultivated crop species or varieties in agroecosystems are still under scrutiny. The available empirical evidence is scattered in scope, agronomic and geographic contexts, and impacts on ecosystem services may depend on the type of diversification strategy used. To robustly assess the effects of crop diversification in agroecosystems, we compiled the results of 95 meta-analyses integrating 5156 experiments conducted over 84 experimental years and representing more than 54,500 paired observations on 120 crop species in 85 countries. Overall, our synthesis of experimental data from across the globe shows that crop diversification enhances not only crop production (median effect +14%) but also the associated biodiversity (+24%, i.e., the biodiversity of non-cultivated plants and animals), and several supporting and regulating ecosystem services including water quality (+51%), pest and disease control (+63%) and soil quality (+11%). However, there was substantial variability in the results for each individual ecosystem service between different diversification strategies such as agroforestry, intercropping, cover crops, crop rotation or variety mixtures. Agroforestry is particularly effective in delivering multiple ecosystem services, that is, water regulation and quality, pest and diseases regulation, associated biodiversity, long-term soil productivity and quality. Variety mixtures, instead, provide the lowest benefits, whereas the other strategies show intermediate results. Our results highlight that while increasing the diversity of cultivated crop species or varieties in agroecosystems represents a very promising strategy for more sustainable land management, contributing to enhanced yields, enhanced biodiversity and ecosystem services, some crop diversification strategies are more effective than others in supporting key ecosystem services.

We examine the current state and recent trajectories of 19 ecosystems, spanning 58 degrees of latitude across 7.7 M km(2), from Australia's coral reefs to terrestrial Antarctica. Pressures from global climate change and regional human impacts, occurring as chronic 'presses' and/or acute 'pulses', drive ecosystem collapse. Ecosystem responses to 5-17 pressures were categorised as four collapse profiles-abrupt, smooth, stepped and fluctuating. The manifestation of widespread ecosystem collapse is a stark warning of the necessity to take action. We present a three-step assessment and management framework (3As Pathway Awareness, Anticipation and Action) to aid strategic and effective mitigation to alleviate further degradation to help secure our future.

Nonetheless, the response pattern of Q(10) to continuous warming and the underlying mechanisms are still under debate, especially considering the complex interactions between Q(10), SOM quality, and soil microorganisms. We examined the Q(10) of SOM decomposition across a mean annual temperature (MAT) gradient from -1.9 to 5.1 degrees C in temperate mixed forest ecosystems in parallel with SOM quality and bioavailability, microbial taxonomic composition, and functional genes responsible for organic carbon decomposition. Within this temperature gradient of 7.0 degrees C, the Q(10) values increased with MAT, but decreased with SOM bioavailability. The Q(10) values increased with the prevalence of K-strategy of soil microbial community, which was characterized by: (i) high ratios of oligotrophic to copiotrophic taxa, (ii) ectomycorrhizal to saprotrophic fungi, (iii) functional genes responsible for degradation of recalcitrant to that of labile C, and (iv) low average 16S rRNA operon copy number. Because the recalcitrant organic matter was mainly utilized by the K-strategists, these findings independently support the carbon quality-temperature theory from the perspective of microbial taxonomic composition and functions. A year-long incubation experiment was performed to determine the response of labile and recalcitrant C pools to warming based on the two-pool model. The decomposition of recalcitrant SOM was more sensitive to increased temperature in southern warm regions, which might attribute to the dominance of K-selected microbial communities. It implies that climate warming would mobilize the larger recalcitrant pools in warm regions, exacerbating the positive feedback between increased MAT and CO2 efflux. This is the first attempt to link temperature sensitivity of SOM decomposition with microbial eco-strategies by incorporating the genetic information and disentangling the complex relationship between Q(10) and soil microorganisms.

By quantifying the plant- and microbial-derived C in soils across four climate zones, we identified that organic C accrual is achieved via contrasting pathways in paddy and upland soils. Paddies are 39%-127% more efficient in soil organic C (SOC) sequestration than their adjacent upland counterparts, with greater differences in warmer than cooler climates. Upland soils are more replenished by microbial-derived C, whereas paddy soils are enriched with a greater proportion of plant-derived C, because of the retarded microbial decomposition under anaerobic conditions induced by the flooding of paddies. Under both land-use types, the maximal contribution of plant residues to SOC is at intermediate mean annual temperature (15-20 degrees C), neutral soil (pH similar to 7.3), and low clay/sand ratio. By contrast, high temperature (similar to 24 degrees C), low soil pH (similar to 5), and large clay/sand ratio are favorable for strengthening the contribution of microbial necromass. The greater contribution of microbial necromass to SOC in waterlogged paddies in warmer climates is likely due to the fast anabolism from bacteria, whereas fungi are unlikely to be involved as they are aerobic. In the scenario of land-use conversion from paddy to upland, a total of 504 Tg C may be lost as CO2 from paddy soils (0-15 cm) solely in eastern China, with 90% released from the less protected plant-derived C. Hence, preserving paddy systems and other anthropogenic wetlands and increasing their C storage through sustainable management are critical for maintaining global soil C stock and mitigating climate change.

Specifically, whether soil microbial physiology parameters and residual materials are important to soil organic C (SOC) content is still unclear. Here, we explored the effects of biotic and abiotic factors on SOC content based on a survey of soils from 16 locations along a similar to 4000 km forest transect in eastern China, spanning a wide range of climate, soil conditions, and microbial communities. We found that SOC was highly correlated with soil microbial biomass C (MBC) and amino sugar (AS) concentration, an index of microbial necromass. Microbial C use efficiency (CUE) was significantly related to the variations in SOC along this national-scale transect. Furthermore, the effect of climatic and edaphic factors on SOC was mainly via their regulation on microbial physiological properties (CUE and MBC). We also found that regression models on explanation of SOC variations with microbial physiological parameters and AS performed better than the models without them. Our results provide the empirical linkages among climate, microbial characteristics, and SOC content at large scale and confirm the necessity of incorporating microbial biomass and necromass pools in ESMs under global change scenarios.

Increasing reactive nitrogen (N) in ecosystems caused by anthropogenic N input substantially affects SOC dynamics. However, uncertainties remain concerning the effects of N addition on SOC in both organic and mineral soil layers over time at the global scale. Here, we analysed a large empirical data set spanning 60 years across 369 sites worldwide to explore the temporal dynamics of SOC to N addition. We found that N addition significantly increased SOC across the globe by 4.2% (2.7%-5.8%). SOC increases were amplified from short- to long-term N addition durations in both organic and mineral soil layers. The positive effects of N addition on SOC were independent of ecosystem types, mean annual temperature and precipitation. Our findings suggest that SOC increases largely resulted from the enhanced plant C input to soils coupled with reduced C loss from decomposition and amplification was associated with reduced microbial biomass and respiration under long-term N addition. Our study suggests that N addition will enhance SOC sequestration over time and contribute to future climate change mitigation.

However, the temporal variation in vegetation carbon sequestration remains unclear, and the relative effects of climate change and ecological restoration efforts are under debate. By integrating remote sensing and machine learning with a modelling approach, we explored the biological and physical pathways by which both climate change and human activities (e.g., ecological restoration, cropland expansion, and urbanization) have altered Chinese terrestrial ecosystem structures and functions, including vegetation cover, surface heat fluxes, water flux, and vegetation carbon sequestration (defined by gross and net primary production, GPP and NPP). Our study indicated that during 2001-2018, GPP in China increased significantly at a rate of 49.1-53.1 TgC/yr(2), and the climatic and anthropogenic contributions to GPP gains were comparable (48%-56% and 44%-52%, respectively). Spatially, afforestation was the dominant mechanism behind forest cover expansions in the farming-pastoral ecotone in northern China, on the Loess Plateau and in the southwest karst region, whereas climate change promoted vegetation cover in most parts of southeastern China. At the same time, the increasing trend in NPP (22.4-24.9 TgC/yr(2)) during 2001-2018 was highly attributed to human activities (71%-81%), particularly in southern, eastern, and northeastern China. Both GPP and NPP showed accelerated increases after 2010 because the anthropogenic NPP gains during 2001-2010 were generally offset by the climate-induced NPP losses in southern China. However, after 2010, the climatic influence reversed, thus highlighting the vegetation carbon sequestration that occurs with ecological restoration.

Here, we show that during the 2015-2019 period, the Mediterranean Sea has experienced exceptional thermal conditions resulting in the onset of five consecutive years of widespread MMEs across the basin. These MMEs affected thousands of kilometers of coastline from the surface to 45 m, across a range of marine habitats and taxa (50 taxa across 8 phyla). Significant relationships were found between the incidence of MMEs and the heat exposure associated with MHWs observed both at the surface and across depths. Our findings reveal that the Mediterranean Sea is experiencing an acceleration of the ecological impacts of MHWs which poses an unprecedented threat to its ecosystems' health and functioning. Overall, we show that increasing the resolution of empirical observation is critical to enhancing our ability to more effectively understand and manage the consequences of climate change.

Patterns and drivers of global gross nitrogen mineralization in soils	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						N-15 isotope dilution technique; climate; ecosystems; gross nitrogen mineralization; microbial biomass; soil properties	MICROBIAL BIOMASS; ENZYME-ACTIVITIES; ORGANIC-MATTER; N MINERALIZATION; FOREST ECOSYSTEM; LAND-USES; CARBON; RESPONSES; PH; TRANSFORMATIONS	Soil gross nitrogen (N) mineralization (GNM), a key microbial process in the global N cycle, is mainly controlled by climate and soil properties. This study provides for the first time a comprehensive analysis of the role of soil physicochemical properties and climate and their interactions with soil microbial biomass (MB) in controlling GNM globally. Through a meta-analysis of 970 observations from 337 published papers from various ecosystems, we found that GNM was positively correlated with MB, total carbon, total N and precipitation, and negatively correlated with bulk density (BD) and soil pH. Our multivariate analysis and structural equation modeling revealed that GNM is driven by MB and dominantly influenced by BD and precipitation. The higher total N accelerates GNM via increasing MB. The decrease in BD stimulates GNM via increasing total N and MB, whereas higher precipitation stimulates GNM via increasing total N. Moreover, the GNM varies with ecosystem type, being greater in forests and grasslands with high total carbon and MB contents and low BD and pH compared to croplands. The highest GNM was observed in tropical wet soils that receive high precipitation, which increases the supply of soil substrate (total N) to microbes. Our findings suggest that anthropogenic activities that affect soil microbial population size, BD, soil substrate availability, or soil pH may interact with changes in precipitation regime and land use to influence GNM, which may ultimately affect ecosystem productivity and N loss to the environment.

Building on previous studies, we refine and update the mitigation potentials for 20 land-based measures in >200 countries and five regions, comparing "bottom-up" sectoral estimates with integrated assessment models (IAMs). We also assess implementation feasibility at the country level. Cost-effective (available up to $100/tCO(2)eq) land-based mitigation is 8-13.8 GtCO(2)eq yr(-1) between 2020 and 2050, with the bottom end of this range representing the IAM median and the upper end representing the sectoral estimate. The cost-effective sectoral estimate is about 40% of available technical potential and is in line with achieving a 1.5 degrees C pathway in 2050. Compared to technical potentials, cost-effective estimates represent a more realistic and actionable target for policy. The cost-effective potential is approximately 50% from forests and other ecosystems, 35% from agriculture, and 15% from demand-side measures. The potential varies sixfold across the five regions assessed (0.75-4.8 GtCO2eq yr(-1)) and the top 15 countries account for about 60% of the global potential. Protection of forests and other ecosystems and demand-side measures present particularly high mitigation efficiency, high provision of co-benefits, and relatively lower costs. The feasibility assessment suggests that governance, economic investment, and socio-cultural conditions influence the likelihood that land-based mitigation potentials are realized. A substantial portion of potential (80%) is in developing countries and LDCs, where feasibility barriers are of greatest concern. Assisting countries to overcome barriers may result in significant quantities of near-term, low-cost mitigation while locally achieving important climate adaptation and development benefits. Opportunities among countries vary widely depending on types of land-based measures available, their potential co-benefits and risks, and their feasibility. Enhanced investments and country-specific plans that accommodate this complexity are urgently needed to realize the large global potential from improved land stewardship.

Statistical models are increasingly used to predict (i.e., upscale) CO2 fluxes across large spatial domains, but the reliability of different modeling techniques, each with different specifications and assumptions, has not been assessed in detail. Here, we compile eddy covariance and chamber measurements of annual and growing season CO2 fluxes of gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER), and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) during 1990-2015 from 148 terrestrial high-latitude (i.e., tundra and boreal) sites to analyze the spatial patterns and drivers of CO2 fluxes and test the accuracy and uncertainty of different statistical models. CO2 fluxes were upscaled at relatively high spatial resolution (1 km(2)) across the high-latitude region using five commonly used statistical models and their ensemble, that is, the median of all five models, using climatic, vegetation, and soil predictors. We found the performance of machine learning and ensemble predictions to outperform traditional regression methods. We also found the predictive performance of NEE-focused models to be low, relative to models predicting GPP and ER. Our data compilation and ensemble predictions showed that CO2 sink strength was larger in the boreal biome (observed and predicted average annual NEE -46 and -29 g C m(-2) yr(-1), respectively) compared to tundra (average annual NEE +10 and -2 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). This pattern was associated with large spatial variability, reflecting local heterogeneity in soil organic carbon stocks, climate, and vegetation productivity. The terrestrial ecosystem CO2 budget, estimated using the annual NEE ensemble prediction, suggests the high-latitude region was on average an annual CO2 sink during 1990-2015, although uncertainty remains high.

Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) range contraction and expansion in Europe under changing climate	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						bioclimatic modeling; biological invasions; forest management; MaxEnt; nature conservation; niche modeling; species distribution models	INVASIVE TREE; FOREST MANAGEMENT; BIOLOGICAL FLORA; CHANGE IMPACTS; RADIAL GROWTH; OAK GROWTH; SCOTS PINE; PLANTATIONS; VEGETATION; DROUGHT	Robinia pseudoacacia is one of the most frequent non-native species in Europe. It is a fast-growing tree of high economic and cultural importance. On the other hand, it is an invasive species, causing changes in soil chemistry and light regime, and consequently altering the plant communities. Previously published models developed for the potential distribution of R. pseudoacacia concerned 2070, and were based mainly on data from Western and Central Europe; here we extended these findings and included additional data from Eastern Europe. To fill the gap in current knowledge of R. pseudoacacia distribution and improve the reliability of forecasts, we aimed to (i) determine the extent to which the outcome of range modeling will be affected by complementing R. pseudoacacia occurrence data with sites from Central, Southeastern, and Eastern Europe, (ii) identify and quantify the changes in the availability of climate niches for 2050 and 2070, and discuss their impacts on forest management and nature conservation. We showed that the majority of the range changes expected in 2070 will occur as early as 2050. In comparison to previous studies, we demonstrated a greater eastward shift of potential niches of this species and a greater decline of potential niches in Southern Europe. Consequently, future climatic conditions will likely favor the occurrence of R. pseudoacacia in Central and Northeastern Europe where this species is still absent or relatively rare. There, controlling the spread of R. pseudoacacia will require monitoring sources of invasion in the landscape and reducing the occurrence of this species. The expected effects of climate change will likely be observed 20 years earlier than previously forecasted. Hence we highlighted the urgent need for acceleration of policies aimed at climate change mitigation in Europe. Also, our results showed the need for using more complete distribution data to analyze potential niche models.

Extreme heat increases stomatal conductance and drought-induced mortality risk in vulnerable plant species	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						drought stress; heatwave; high temperature tolerance; leaf critical temperature; thermal safety margin; water deficit experiment	CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; HIGH-TEMPERATURE; TREE MORTALITY; RESPONSES; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; TOLERANCE; TRANSPIRATION; SIZE; VARIABILITY; SENSITIVITY	Tree mortality during global-change-type drought is usually attributed to xylem dysfunction, but as climate change increases the frequency of extreme heat events, it is necessary to better understand the interactive role of heat stress. We hypothesized that some drought-stressed plants paradoxically open stomata in heatwaves to prevent leaves from critically overheating. We experimentally imposed heat (>40 degrees C) and drought stress onto 20 broadleaf evergreen tree/shrub species in a glasshouse study. Most well-watered plants avoided lethal overheating, but drought exacerbated thermal damage during heatwaves. Thermal safety margins (TSM) quantifying the difference between leaf surface temperature and leaf critical temperature, where photosynthesis is disrupted, identified species vulnerability to heatwaves. Several mechanisms contributed to high heat tolerance and avoidance of damaging leaf temperatures-small leaf size, low leaf osmotic potential, high leaf mass per area (i.e., thick, dense leaves), high transpirational capacity, and access to water. Water-stressed plants had smaller TSM, greater crown dieback, and a fundamentally different stomatal heatwave response relative to well-watered plants. On average, well-watered plants closed stomata and decreased stomatal conductance (g(s)) during the heatwave, but droughted plants did not. Plant species with low g(s), either due to isohydric stomatal behavior under water deficit or inherently low transpirational capacity, opened stomata and increased g(s) under high temperatures. The current paradigm maintains that stomata close before hydraulic thresholds are surpassed, but our results suggest that isohydric species may dramatically increase g(s) (over sixfold increases) even past their leaf turgor loss point. By actively increasing water loss at high temperatures, plants can be driven toward mortality thresholds more rapidly than has been previously recognized. The inclusion of TSM and responses to heat stress could improve our ability to predict the vulnerability of different tree species to future droughts.

Future carbon emissions from global mangrove forest loss	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						blue carbon; carbon sequestration; climate change; coastal wetlands; erosion; greenhouse gases; Nationally Determined Contributions; tropical storms	COASTAL; CONSERVATION; STORAGE; DEFORESTATION; MARSHES; BRAZIL; WORLD	Mangroves have among the highest carbon densities of any tropical forest. These 'blue carbon' ecosystems can store large amounts of carbon for long periods, and their protection reduces greenhouse gas emissions and supports climate change mitigation. Incorporating mangroves into Nationally Determined Contributions to the Paris Agreement and their valuation on carbon markets requires predicting how the management of different land-uses can prevent future greenhouse gas emissions and increase CO2 sequestration. We integrated comprehensive global datasets for carbon stocks, mangrove distribution, deforestation rates, and land-use change drivers into a predictive model of mangrove carbon emissions. We project emissions and foregone soil carbon sequestration potential under 'business as usual' rates of mangrove loss. Emissions from mangrove loss could reach 2391 Tg CO2 eq by the end of the century, or 3392 Tg CO2 eq when considering foregone soil carbon sequestration. The highest emissions were predicted in southeast and south Asia (West Coral Triangle, Sunda Shelf, and the Bay of Bengal) due to conversion to aquaculture or agriculture, followed by the Caribbean (Tropical Northwest Atlantic) due to clearing and erosion, and the Andaman coast (West Myanmar) and north Brazil due to erosion. Together, these six regions accounted for 90% of the total potential CO2 eq future emissions. Mangrove loss has been slowing, and global emissions could be more than halved if reduced loss rates remain in the future. Notably, the location of global emission hotspots was consistent with every dataset used to calculate deforestation rates or with alternative assumptions about carbon storage and emissions. Our results indicate the regions in need of policy actions to address emissions arising from mangrove loss and the drivers that could be managed to prevent them.

Here we collected topsoil and subsoil samples along an elevational gradient on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau to explore the temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of SOC decomposition in relation to changes in microbial communities. Specifically, we tested whether the decomposition of SOC would be more sensitive to warming when microbial diversity is low. The estimated Q(10) value ranged from 1.28 to 1.68, and 1.80 to 2.10 in the topsoil and subsoil, respectively. The highest Q(10) value was observed at the lowest altitude of forests in the topsoil, and at the highest altitude of alpine meadow in the subsoil. Variations in Q(10) were closely related to changes in microbial properties. In the topsoil the ratio of gram-positive to gram-negative bacteria (G+:G-) was the predominant factor associated with the altitudinal variations in Q(10). In the subsoil, SOC decomposition showed more resilience to warming when the diversity of soil bacteria (both whole community and major groups) and fungi was higher. Our results partly support the positive biodiversity-ecosystem stability hypothesis. Structural equation modeling further indicates that variations in Q(10) in the subsoil were directly related to changes in microbial diversity and community composition, which were affected by soil pH. Collectively our results provide compelling evidence that microbial biodiversity plays an important role in stabilizing SOC decomposition in the subsoil of alpine montane ecosystems. Conservation of belowground biodiversity is therefore of great importance in maintaining the stability of ecosystem processes under climate change in high-elevation regions of the Tibetan Plateau.

Soil GN is thought to be mainly controlled by soil characteristics and the climate, but a comprehensive analysis taking into account the climate, soil characteristics, including microbial characteristics, and their interactions to better understand the direct and indirect controlling factors of GN rates globally is lacking. Using a global meta-analysis based on 901 observations from 330 N-15-labeled studies, we show that GN differs significantly among ecosystem types, with the highest rates found in croplands, in association with higher pH which stimulates nitrifying bacteria activities. Autotrophic and heterotrophic nitrifications contribute 63% and 37%, respectively, to global GN. Soil GN increases significantly with soil total N, microbial biomass, and soil pH, but decreases significantly with soil carbon (C) to N ratio (C:N). Structural equation modeling suggested that GN is mainly controlled by C:N and soil total N. Microbial biomass and pH are also important factors controlling GN and their effects are similar. Precipitation and temperature affect GN by altering C:N and/or soil total N. Soil total N and temperature drive heterotrophic nitrification, whereas C:N and pH drive autotrophic nitrification. Moreover, GN is positively related to nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide emissions. This synthesis suggests that changes in soil C:N, soil total N, microbial population size, and/or soil pH due to anthropogenic activities may influence GN, which will affect nitrate accumulation and gaseous emissions of soils under global climate and land-use changes.

As crop and plant growth are significantly hampered under acidic soil conditions, many farmers, but increasingly as well forest managers, apply lime to raise the soil pH. Besides its direct effect on soil pH, liming also affects soil C and nutrient cycles and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes. In this meta-analysis, we reviewed 1570 observations reported in 121 field-based studies worldwide, to assess liming effects on soil GHG fluxes and plant productivity. We found that liming significantly increases crop yield by 36.3%. Also, soil organic C (SOC) stocks were found to increase by 4.51% annually, though soil respiration is stimulated too (7.57%). Moreover, liming was found to reduce soil N2O emission by 21.3%, yield-scaled N2O emission by 21.5%, and CH4 emission and yield-scaled CH4 emission from rice paddies by 19.0% and 12.4%, respectively. Assuming that all acid agricultural soils are limed periodically, liming results in a total GHG balance benefit of 633-749 Tg CO2-eq year(-1) due to reductions in soil N2O emissions (0.60-0.67 Tg N2O-N year(-1)) and paddy soil CH4 emissions (1.75-2.21 Tg CH4 year(-1)) and increases in SOC stocks (65.7-110 Tg C year(-1)). However, this comes at the cost of an additional CO2 release (c. 624-656 Tg CO2 year(-1)) deriving from lime mining, transport and application, and lime dissolution, so that the overall GHG balance is likely neutral. Nevertheless, liming of acid agricultural soils will increase yields by at least 6.64 x 10(8) Mg year(-1), covering the food supply of 876 million people. Overall, our study shows for the first time that a general strategy of liming of acid agricultural soils is likely to result in an increasing sustainability of global agricultural production, indicating the potential benefit of liming acid soils for climate change mitigation and food security.

Although China is acknowledged as a global leader of forestation and has achieved considerable overall success in environmental improvements through mega-forestation programs, many negative effects have also emerged at local scales due to the planting of maladapted tree species. To better help achieve carbon neutrality and the new vision of an ecological civilization, China has committed to further increase forestation. However, where forestation lands and such efforts should really be located is not so well understood yet and agreed upon, especially in the face of rapid climate change. Based on an ensemble-learning machine, we predicted the spatial habitats (ecological niche) of the forest, grassland, shrubland, and desert under present and future climate conditions based on the natural climax vegetation distribution across China. We show that the potential forestation lands are mainly located in eastern China, which is east of the Hu Line (also known as the Heihe-Tengchong Line). Under future climate change, forests will shift substantially in the latitudinal, longitudinal, and elevational distribution. Potential forestation lands will increase by 33.1 million hectares through the 2070s, mainly due to the conversions of shrub and grassland to forests along the Hu Line. Our prediction map also indicates that grassland rehabilitation is the universal optimal vegetation restoration strategy in areas west of the Hu Line. This analysis is consistent with much of the observed evidence of forestation failures and recent climate-change-induced forest range shifts. Our results provide an overview and further show the importance of adaptive science-based forestation planning and forest management.

Effective strategies to adapt forests to such droughts require comprehensive information on the effects and importance of the factors influencing forest resistance and resilience. We used a unique combination of inventory and dendrochronological data from a long-term (>30 years) silvicultural experiment in mixed silver fir and Norway spruce mountain forests along a temperature and precipitation gradient in southwestern Germany. We aimed at examining the mechanisms and forest stand characteristics underpinning the resistance and resilience to past mild and severe droughts. We found that (i) fir benefited from mild droughts and showed higher resistance (i.e., lower growth loss during drought) and resilience (i.e., faster return to pre-drought growth levels) than spruce to all droughts; (ii) species identity determined mild drought responses while species interactions and management-related factors strongly influenced the responses to severe droughts; (iii) intraspecific and interspecific interactions had contrasting effects on the two species, with spruce being less resistant to severe droughts when exposed to interaction with fir and beech; (iv) higher values of residual stand basal area following thinning were associated with lower resistance and resilience to severe droughts; and (v) larger trees were resilient to mild drought events but highly vulnerable to severe droughts. Our study provides an analytical approach for examining the effects of different factors on individual tree- and stand-level drought response. The forests investigated here were to a certain extent resilient to mild droughts, and even benefited from such conditions, but were strongly affected by severe droughts. Lastly, negative effects of severe droughts can be reduced through modifying species composition, tree size distribution and stand density in mixed silver fir-Norway spruce forests.

The role of fire in global forest loss dynamics	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						active fires; burned area; deforestation; fire; forest loss; satellite data; tree mortality	CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; EL-NINO; ACTIVE FIRES; COVER LOSS; OIL PALM; DEFORESTATION; EMISSIONS; DRIVEN; AMAZON; ALGORITHM	Fires, among other forms of natural and anthropogenic disturbance, play a central role in regulating the location, composition and biomass of forests. Understanding the role of fire in global forest loss is crucial in constraining land-use change emissions and the global carbon cycle. We analysed the relationship between forest loss and fire at 500 m resolution based on satellite-derived data for the 2003-2018 period. Satellite fire data included burned area and active fire detections, to best account for large and small fires, respectively. We found that, on average, 38 +/- 9% (+/- range) of global forest loss was associated with fire, and this fraction remained relatively stable throughout the study period. However, the fraction of fire-related forest loss varied substantially on a regional basis, and showed statistically significant trends in key tropical forest areas. Decreases in the fraction of fire-related forest loss were found where deforestation peaked early in our study period, including the Amazon and Indonesia while increases were found for tropical forests in Africa. The inclusion of active fire detections accounted for 41%, on average, of the total fire-related forest loss, with larger contributions in small clearings in interior tropical forests and human-dominated landscapes. Comparison to higher-resolution fire data with resolutions of 375 and 20 m indicated that commission errors due to coarse resolution fire data largely balanced out omission errors due to missed small fire detections for regional to continental-scale estimates of fire-related forest loss. Besides an improved understanding of forest dynamics, these findings may help to refine and separate fire-related and non-fire-related land-use change emissions in forested ecosystems.

J	Senf, C; Seidl, R				Senf, Cornelius; Seidl, Rupert			Storm and fire disturbances in Europe: Distribution and trends	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						climate extremes; fire; forest mortality; Landsat; windthrow	LANDSAT TIME-SERIES; FOREST DISTURBANCE; DETECTING TRENDS; MANAGEMENT; WIND; ATTRIBUTION; DATABASE; DRIVERS; WESTERN; EVENTS	Abiotic forest disturbances are an important driver of ecosystem dynamics. In Europe, storms and fires have been identified as the most important abiotic disturbances in the recent past. Yet, how strongly these agents drive local disturbance regimes compared to other agents (e.g., biotic, human) remains unresolved. Furthermore, whether storms and fires are responsible for the observed increase in forest disturbances in Europe is debated. Here, we provide quantitative evidence for the prevalence of storm and fire disturbances in Europe 1986-2016. For 27 million disturbance patches mapped from satellite data, we determined whether they were caused by storm or fire, using a random forest classifier and a large reference dataset of true disturbance occurrences. We subsequently analyzed patterns of disturbance prevalence (i.e., the share of an agent on the overall area disturbed) in space and time. Storm- and fire-related disturbances each accounted for approximately 7% of all disturbances recorded in Europe in the period 1986-2016. Storm-related disturbances were most prevalent in western and central Europe, where they locally accounted for >50% of all disturbances, but we also identified storm-related disturbances in south-eastern and eastern Europe. Fire-related disturbances were a major disturbance agent in southern and south-eastern Europe, but fires also occurred in eastern and northern Europe. The prevalence and absolute area of storm-related disturbances increased over time, whereas no trend was detected for fire-related disturbances. Overall, we estimate an average of 127,716 (97,680-162,725) ha of storm-related disturbances per year and an average of 141,436 (107,353-181,022) ha of fire-related disturbances per year. We conclude that abiotic disturbances caused by storm and fire are important drivers of forest dynamics in Europe, but that their influence varies substantially by region. Our analysis further suggests that increasing storm-related disturbances are an important driver of Europe's changing forest disturbance regimes.

However, variation in patterns and drivers of rainfall partitioning across global biomes remains poorly understood, which limited the ability of climate models to improve the predictions of biome hydrological cycle under global climate change scenario. Here, we synthesized and analyzed the partitioning of incident rainfall into interception, stemflow, and throughfall by trees and shrubs at the global scale using 2430 observations from 236 independent publications. We found that (1) globally, median levels of relative interception, stemflow, and throughfall accounted for 21.8%, 3.2%, and 73.0% of total incident rainfall, respectively; (2) rainfall partitioning varied among different biomes, due to variation in plant composition, canopy structure, and macroclimate; (3) relative stemflow tended to be driven by plant traits, such as crown height:width ratio, basal area, and height, while relative interception and throughfall tended to be driven by plant traits as well as meteorological variables. Our global assessment of patterns and drivers of rainfall partitioning underpins the role of meteorological factors and plant traits in biome-specific ecohydrological cycles. We suggest to include these factors in climate models to improve the predictions of local hydrological cycles and associated biodiversity and function responses to changing climate conditions.

Heatwave-induced synchrony within forage fish portfolio disrupts energy flow to top pelagic predators	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						ecosystem response; forage fish; Gulf of Alaska; marine heatwave; portfolio effects	PRINCE-WILLIAM-SOUND; CAPELIN MALLOTUS-VILLOSUS; PACIFIC SAND LANCE; CLIMATE-RELATED VARIABILITY; NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CURRENT; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; REGIME SHIFTS; LIFE-HISTORY; ZOOPLANKTON ABUNDANCE; AMMODYTES-HEXAPTERUS	During the Pacific marine heatwave of 2014-2016, abundance and quality of several key forage fish species in the Gulf of Alaska were simultaneously reduced throughout the system. Capelin (Mallotus catervarius), sand lance (Ammodytes personatus), and herring (Clupea pallasii) populations were at historically low levels, and within this community abrupt declines in portfolio effects identify trophic instability at the onset of the heatwave. Although compensatory changes in age structure, size, growth or energy content of forage fish were observed to varying degrees among all these forage fish, none were able to fully mitigate adverse impacts of the heatwave, which likely included both top-down and bottom-up forcing. Notably, changes to the demographic structure of forage fish suggested size-selective removals typical of top-down regulation. At the same time, changes in zooplankton communities may have driven bottom-up regulation as copepod community structure shifted toward smaller, warm water species, and euphausiid biomass was reduced owing to the loss of cold-water species. Mediated by these impacts on the forage fish community, an unprecedented disruption of the normal pelagic food web was signaled by higher trophic level disruptions during 2015-2016, when seabirds, marine mammals, and groundfish experienced shifts in distribution, mass mortalities, and reproductive failures. Unlike decadal-scale variability underlying ecosystem regime shifts, the heatwave appeared to temporarily overwhelm the ability of the forage fish community to buffer against changes imposed by warm water anomalies, thereby eliminating any ecological advantages that may have accrued from having a suite of coexisting forage species with differing life-history compensations.

Moisture availability mediates the relationship between terrestrial gross primary production and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence: Insights from global-scale variations	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						fluorescence escaping ratio; gross primary production (GPP); moisture stress; random forest; solar&#8208; induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF); stomatal openness	SUN-INDUCED FLUORESCENCE; NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION; CARBON-CYCLE; DOUGLAS-FIR; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; RETRIEVAL; CANOPY; ECOSYSTEMS; REFLECTANCE; SENSITIVITY	Effective use of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) to estimate and monitor gross primary production (GPP) in terrestrial ecosystems requires a comprehensive understanding and quantification of the relationship between SIF and GPP. To date, this understanding is incomplete and somewhat controversial in the literature. Here we derived the GPP/SIF ratio from multiple data sources as a diagnostic metric to explore its global-scale patterns of spatial variation and potential climatic dependence. We found that the growing season GPP/SIF ratio varied substantially across global land surfaces, with the highest ratios consistently found in boreal regions. Spatial variation in GPP/SIF was strongly modulated by climate variables. The most striking pattern was a consistent decrease in GPP/SIF from cold-and-wet climates to hot-and-dry climates. We propose that the reduction in GPP/SIF with decreasing moisture availability may be related to stomatal responses to aridity. Furthermore, we show that GPP/SIF can be empirically modeled from climate variables using a machine learning (random forest) framework, which can improve the modeling of ecosystem production and quantify its uncertainty in global terrestrial biosphere models. Our results point to the need for targeted field and experimental studies to better understand the patterns observed and to improve the modeling of the relationship between SIF and GPP over broad scales.

By collecting soils along a tropical forest elevation gradient, we conducted an incubation experiment with C-13-labeled glucose and nutrient (N and/or P) additions. Results showed that priming effects increased soil organic matter decomposition by 44 +/- 12% across elevations, and priming intensity decreased significantly with elevation. Among soil and microbial properties, soil organic carbon (SOC) content and pH were two key factors negatively and positively regulating priming, respectively. Across elevations, the additions of N, P, or both of them (NP) did not significantly change priming. However, the variations in the effects of nutrient (N and/or P) addition on priming significantly correlated with initial soil nutrient (N or P) availability. The intensity for the effects of N addition on priming decreased significantly with initial soil N availability, and that for the effects of P and NP addition on priming decreased with initial soil P availability. Based on these relationships, we proposed a conceptual framework linking stoichiometric decomposition and nutrient mining hypotheses, in which the former dominates in low-nutrient availability soils and the latter dominates in high-nutrient availability soils. This conceptual framework can help to explain the contrasting effects of nutrient addition on priming. Collectively, our findings highlight the roles of SOC content and soil pH in regulating priming intensity, and the role of initial soil nutrient availability in regulating the effects of nutrient addition on priming.

Here, we present new results on the source, decomposition, and storage of SOC in estuarine wetlands with four vegetation types, including single Phragmites australis (P, habitat I), a mixture of P. australis and Suaeda salsa (P + S, habitat II), single S. salsa (S, habitat III), and tidal flat (TF, habitat IV) across a salinity gradient. Values of delta C-13 increased with depth in aerobic soil layers (0-40 cm) but slightly decreased in anaerobic soil layers (40-100 cm). The delta N-15 was significantly enriched in soil organic matter at all depths than in the living plant tissues, indicating a preferential decomposition of N-14-enriched organic components. Thus, the kinetic isotope fractionation during microbial degradation and the preferential substrate utilization are the dominant mechanisms in regulating isotopic compositions in aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively. Stable isotopic (delta C-13 and delta N-15), elemental (C and N), and lignin composition (inherited (Ad/Al)s and C/V) were not completely consistent in reflecting the differences in SOC decomposition or accumulation among four vegetation types, possibly due to differences in litter inputs, root distributions, substrate quality, water-table level, salinity, and microbial community composition/activity. Organic C contents and storage decreased from upstream to downstream, likely due to primarily changes in autochthonous sources (e.g., decreased onsite plant biomass input) and allochthonous materials (e.g., decreased fluvially transported upland river inputs, and increased tidally induced marine algae and phytoplankton). Our results revealed that multiple indicators are essential to unravel the degree of SOC decomposition and accumulation, and a combination of C:N ratios, delta C-13, delta N-15, and lignin biomarker provides a robust approach to decipher the decomposition and source of sedimentary organic matter along the river-estuary-ocean continuum.

Precipitation-productivity relationships and the duration of precipitation anomalies: An underappreciated dimension of climate change	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						climate change; climate extremes; deluge; drought; net primary productivity; precipitation; precipitation&#8211; productivity relationships; temporal dynamics; vegetation demographics	FOREST DIE-OFF; FUNCTIONAL COMPOSITION; ECOSYSTEM SENSITIVITY; LINKING DROUGHT; AMAZON FOREST; GREAT-PLAINS; RESPONSES; VEGETATION; INCREASES; SHIFTS	In terrestrial ecosystems, climate change forecasts of increased frequencies and magnitudes of wet and dry precipitation anomalies are expected to shift precipitation-net primary productivity (PPT-NPP) relationships from linear to nonlinear. Less understood, however, is how future changes in the duration of PPT anomalies will alter PPT-NPP relationships. A review of the literature shows strong potential for the duration of wet and dry PPT anomalies to impact NPP and to interact with the magnitude of anomalies. Within semi-arid and mesic grassland ecosystems, PPT gradient experiments indicate that short-duration (1 year) PPT anomalies are often insufficient to drive nonlinear aboveground NPP responses. But long-term studies, within desert to forest ecosystems, demonstrate how multi-year PPT anomalies may result in increasing impacts on NPP through time, and thus alter PPT-NPP relationships. We present a conceptual model detailing how NPP responses to PPT anomalies may amplify with the duration of an event, how responses may vary in xeric vs. mesic ecosystems, and how these differences are most likely due to demographic mechanisms. Experiments that can unravel the independent and interactive impacts of the magnitude and duration of wet and dry PPT anomalies are needed, with multi-site long-term PPT gradient experiments particularly well-suited for this task.

Global increase in wildfire risk due to climate-driven declines in fuel moisture	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						climate change; climate reanalysis; fire risk; fuel; fuel moisture; net primary productivity; pyrogeography; wildfire	FIRE WEATHER; BURNED AREA; REGIMES; FOREST; SEASON; MODEL; REANALYSIS; FEEDBACKS; AUSTRALIA; ALGORITHM	There is mounting concern that global wildfire activity is shifting in frequency, intensity, and seasonality in response to climate change. Fuel moisture provides a powerful means of detecting changing fire potential. Here, we use global burned area, weather reanalysis data, and the Canadian fire weather index system to calculate fuel moisture trends for multiscale biogeographic regions across a gradient in vegetation productivity. We quantify the proportion of days in the local fire season between 1979 and 2019, where fuel moisture content is below a critical threshold indicating extreme fire potential. We then associate fuel moisture trends over that period to vegetation productivity and comment on its implications for projected anthropogenic climate change. Overall, there is a strong drying trend across realms, biomes, and the productivity gradient. Even where a wetting trend is observed, this often indicates a trend toward increasing fire activity due to an expected increase in fuel production. The detected trends across the productivity gradient lead us to conclude global fire activity will increase with anthropogenic climate change.	[Ellis, Todd M.; Bowman, David M. J.

Thousands of original studies have focused on these drivers of SOC change and are now compiled in a growing number of meta-analyses. To critically assess the research efforts in this domain, we retrieved and characterized 192 meta-analyses of SOC stocks or concentrations. These meta-analyses comprise more than 13,200 original studies conducted from 1910 to 2020 in 150 countries. First, we show that, despite a growing number of studies over time, the geographical coverage of studies is limited. For example, the effect of land management, land-use change, and climate change on SOC has been only occasionally studied in North and Central Africa, and in the Middle East and Central Asia. Second, the meta-analyses investigated a limited number of land management practices, mostly mineral fertilization, organic amendments, and tillage. Third, the meta-analyses demonstrated relatively low quality and transparency. Lastly, we discuss the mismatch between the increasing number of studies and the need for more local, reusable, and diversified knowledge on how to preserve high SOC stocks or restore depleted SOC stocks.
