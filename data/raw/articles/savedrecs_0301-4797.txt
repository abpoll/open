In doing so, green technology innovations (GTIs) and clean energy are the essential factors that can help to achieve the carbon neutrality goal. Therefore, this paper examines the linkages between green technology innovation and renewable energy and carbon dioxide emissions based on the STIRPAT model in Turkey during the time of 1990-2018. The study used testing like "unit-root" to verify the variables' integrative properties containing the information for structural breaks. Also, the bootstrapping ARDL-bound testing technique is used to analyze the relationship between the variables. The causal relationship between green technology innovation, energy consumption, renewable energy, population, income per capita, and carbon dioxide emissions is tested through a Granger causality test. The empirical findings show that green technology innovation, renewable energy, energy consumption, population, income per capita, and carbon dioxide emissions are co-integrated for the long-term association. Additionally, green technology innovation and renewable energy decline carbon dioxide emissions, whereas energy consumption, population, and per capita enhance carbon emissions. This paper helps the policymakers design a comprehensive policy for strengthening environmental sustainability through green technology innovation and renewable energy, specifically in the region of Turkey.

JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Carbon neutrality; Export diversification; Fiscal decentralization; Renewable energy; Eco-Innovation	CO2 EMISSIONS; FISCAL DECENTRALIZATION; REGULATORY COMPETITION; ENERGY DEMAND; PANEL-DATA; GROWTH; TRADE; DETERMINANTS; IMPACT; RACE	Achieving carbon neutrality is of great importance to many developed and developing countries around the globe. Global warming is one of the leading issues caused by human activities. To cope with environmental challenges, and to achieve carbon neutrality, fiscal decentralization and eco-innovation are promising strategies that can also enable countries and local governments to pursue visible economic growth. This study investigates the role of export diversification, environment-related technological innovation, and fiscal decentralization in effectively achieving carbon neutrality target for 37 OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) economies from 1970 to 2019. For empirical analysis, it uses second-generation tests that deal with heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence issues. To this end, this study employs updated cointegration techniques. The augmented mean group (AMG) approach is used to examine the long-run dynamic equilibrium among the variables of interest. The findings indicate that export diversification and fiscal decentralization followed by GDP growth affect carbon dioxide emission positively. While renewable energy consumption and environment-related technological innovation assure environmental improvement. Additionally, short-run causal and unidirectional links are found running from fiscal decentralization, export diversification, and environment-related technological innovation to carbon emissions. Our findings suggest that OECD partner countries need to be careful while devising fiscal decentralization and export diversification policies. They should increase the share of renewable energy, and expand environment-related technological innovation. Such strategic efforts would direct the OECD countries to meet the climate change mitigation agenda of sustainable development goals.

Evidence from advance panel estimations	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						N-11 countries; Green technology innovation; Renewable energy; CO2 emission; Environmental degradation	UNIT-ROOT TESTS; CO2 EMISSIONS; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; CONSUMPTION; IMPACT; COINTEGRATION; DEPENDENCE; NEXUS; INFERENCE; INCOME	After the Paris Climate Conference (Conference of the Paris COP: 21), most developing countries face challenges to attain a sustainable economy and carbon neutrality targets with minimum CO2 emission. The next eleven (N11) economies are in line with the global phenomena of environmental degradation; very few studies have analyzed the effects of green technology innovation on environmental degradation in N-11 countries. Therefore, the present study addresses the gap and examines green technology innovation and renewable energy with CO2 emission from 1980 to 2018. The present study considers all the issues related to panel data analysis, such as cross-sectional dependence, stationarity, heterogeneity in slope parameters, and structural break with advanced panel estimators. Moreover, the cross-sectional augmented autoregressive distributed lags (CS-ARDL) test results show the negative and significant impact of green technology innovation and renewable energy with CO2 emission in the long run. However, the short-run association of green technology innovation is not significant-further, the results endorsed by the robustness tests such as AMG and CCEMG. To reduce environmental deterioration in N-11 countries, governments are suggested implementing some policies to support green innovation technologies and renewable energy resources.

Using data from G-6 countries from 1978 to 2014 and employing a set of empirical approaches, we find weak evidence of the Environmental Kuznets Curve, while economic growth, capital market expansion, and trade openness are found to be major drivers of carbon emissions. Carbon emissions are also weakly and negatively affected by stock market capitalization and FDI. Moreover, the forecasting performance is quite good, particularly by augmenting the model with energy consumption and oil prices. With respect to climate commitments, our empirical findings reveal important policy implications.

J	Ahmad, M; Wu, YY				Ahmad, Munir; Wu, Yiyun			Combined role of green productivity growth, economic globalization, and eco-innovation in achieving ecological sustainability for OECD economies	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Green productivity growth; Economic globalization; Eco-innovation; Ecological footprint; Financial development; OECD	UNIT-ROOT TESTS; ERROR-CORRECTION; EMISSIONS; COINTEGRATION; ENERGY; REGRESSION	Since climate change is the paramount concern of recent literature, macroeconomic factors such as green growth and economic globalization may play an integral role in achieving ecological sustainability in the presence of eco-innovation. However, the combined contributions of green growth, economic globalization, and ecoinnovation towards achieving ecological sustainability are missing from the existing knowledge. Therefore, we investigate the combined influence of these variables in the presence of human capital, financial development, and gross domestic product on ecological footprint per capita for a panel of 20 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries from 1990 through 2017. The method of panel quantile regression is used to produce sound results across varying levels of the ecological footprint of OECD nations. The main results are as follows: firstly, green productivity growth linearly and non-linearly mitigates the ecological degradation, presenting a more pronounced ecological protection impact for higher quantiles, followed by medium and lower quantiles. Secondly, economic globalization manifests mixed effects: it induces ecological deterioration impact in the absence of its interaction with eco-innovation, while it brings about an ecological protection impact with the interaction term. Thirdly, eco-innovation demonstrates an ecological protection impact for all quantiles, with the most influential impact in countries with higher ecological footprint per capita, followed by medium and lower footprints. Based on empirical results, we propose productive utilization of environmental resources for ecological sustainability through product and process innovation and efficient management practices. Besides, we recommend cultivating energy-efficient and clean environmental technologies for long-term ecological sustainability.

In doing so, environmental sustainability has become a vital concern over the past few decades. To control the pollution from combustion gases and to mitigate the destructive effects of carbon emission on environmental quality, governments and policymakers need to consider the important factors that decrease the net carbon emission level, such as eco-innovation and environmental taxes. The literature on the environmental taxes and eco-innovation to control carbon emission is scant. Therefore, this study fills the knowledge gap by evaluating the dynamic effect of eco-innovation and environmental taxes on the carbon neutrality target in emerging seven (E7) economies from 1995 to 2018 and other control variables. The study uses advanced panel data econometric tools to handle various issues such as cross-section dependence structural break and slope heterogeneity for empirical analysis. The study uses the second-generation panel unit root test, Westerlund's cointegration tests, CS-ARDL long-run and CS-ARDL short-run analysis, AMG, and CCEMG for robustness check. The study's outcomes confirm that eco-innovation and environmental taxes play a major role in carbon abatement and Environmental Kuznet Curve (EKC) presence found in E7 countries.

However, the critical role of trade and renewable electricity output in export diversification-environmental nexus is missing. Therefore, this study investigates the combined influence of trade openness, exports diversification, and renewable electricity output on carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) in China from 1989 through 2019. Applying novel time series econometric techniques robust to structural breaks, following new outcomes are obtained. Firstly, long-run equilibrium cointegration existed among the under-analysis variables. Secondly, export diversification and renewable electricity output are predicted to decelerate CO2, supporting carbon neutrality in the long run. Thirdly, trade openness and gross domestic product accelerated the CO2, delaying carbon neutrality accomplishment. Most importantly, significant structural break dummy interacting with trade openness implicated that during the post-2001 era, China's trade openness extensively deteriorated the environmental quality in the face of trade liberalization obtained after joining the World Trade Organization (WTO). Based on empirical results, export diversification and renewable electricity production policies should be mutually non-exclusive and closely coordinated. Further, to counter the carbon emission acceleration impact of trade openness, increasing the share of green tradable products is suggested. Finally, bilateral trade restructuring is recommended to realize the long-term dream of economic sustainability and carbon neutrality.

JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Renewable energy; Carbon neutrality; Carbon emission reduction; Causal relationship	ENVIRONMENTAL KUZNETS CURVE; CO2 EMISSIONS; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; PARAMETER INSTABILITY; FRESH EVIDENCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; OIL PRICES; CONSUMPTION; SECURITY	When taking into account the general terms on which the global green and low-carbon transition takes place, it can be affirmed that the use of clean and renewable energy, including wind, hydro, solar, etc., is an alternative to the traditional energy sources. The renewable energy industry possesses considerable potential, and has recently become the centre of the global energy landscape. Therefore, this article refers to the rolling-window Granger causality test, in order to explore the role of renewable energy (RE) in reducing the greenhouse gas emissions. By studying the interactions that take place between RE consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, we find that the negative impact of RE on CO2 indicates that the replacement role of RE has become increasingly prominent, for it to effectively contribute towards the realization of carbon emission reduction. The results in this regard are consistent with the energy-environment model, suggesting that RE has an excellent performance in achieving carbon neutrality. In fact, CO2 usually exhibits a negative effect on RE, which indicates towards the predictability of environmental quality to the development potential of renewable energy. Carbon emission reduction has become a game of interest among the countries around the world.

In doing this, the tourism and hospitality businesses have also emerged as an industry that has shown tremendous economic positive outputs and support to an economy with the lease inputs. However, tourism has also been reported to lead to increased environmental degradation as foreigners came to the host country, whereby ecological innovation emerged as a potential so-lution for eliminating the level of carbon emissions. In contrast, researchers are in agreement in terms of its beneficial relationship. Therefore, based on Turkey as the contextual gap and the application of quantile autoregressive distributed lag (QARDL) as the methodological contribution, the present study explores the relationship of tourism and ecological innovation within the framework of Environment Kuznets Curve (EKC) on the environment using two different proxies (carbon emissions and ecological footprint) spanning from 1995 to 2018. The results confirm the EKC curve whereby the parameter estimating tourism and ecological innovation on carbon emissions and ecological footprint, both of the integrations are found negative and statistically significant across most quantiles. Based on the findings, the study is accordingly concluded, followed by the managerial implications.

This study examines how carbon dioxide emissions respond to changes in the tourism development. Panel data from 2000 to 2017 for 70 countries are analyzed using spatial econometric method to investigate the spatial spillover effect of tourism development on environmental pollution. The direct, indirect, and overall impact of tourism on environmental pollution are estimated after the selection of the most appropriate GNS method. The findings reveal that tourism has a positive direct effect and a negative indirect effect; both are significant at the 1 % level. The negative indirect effect of tourism is greater than its direct positive effect, implying an overall significantly negative impact. Further, the outcome of financial development and carbon emissions have an inverted U-shaped and U-shaped relationship in direct and indirect impacts. Population density, trade openness and economic growth significantly influence on environmental pollution through spatial spill over. In addition, education expenditure and infrastructure play a significant moderating role in the relationship among tourism development and environmental pollution. The results have important policy implications as they establish an inverted-Ushaped relationship among tourism and environmental pollution and indicate that while a country's emissions initially rise with the tourism industry's growth, they begin declining after a limit.

Carbon dioxide is the main element to mitigate to achieve climate neutrality on the planet, which is present in fossil fuels highly demanded power generation. This environmental concern, which entails all economic agents' responsibility, has not gone unnoticed, so in 2015 the Paris Climate Conference (COP: 21) was held, whose main objective is to reduce carbon emissions on the planet. Post Paris agreement generates pressure on the signatory countries since the objectives set are a real challenge to achieve environmental sustainability. Thereby, this research aims to examine the long-term determinants of carbon emissions in 19 countries of the European Union that were part of the COP: 21. The Method of Moments' Quantile Regression approach is used, which considers the effects of location and scale in the conditional distribution of carbon emissions. The results show that clean energy, technology and environmental taxes contribute to mitigating carbon emissions; however, economic activity and industrialization causes an increase in environmental degradation. From the results obtained, the findings suggest some policy measures aimed at offsetting carbon emissions.

This study, unlike previous studies, evaluates the role of environmental policy, green innovation, composite risk index, and renewable energy R&D in achieving carbon neutrality targets for G7 economies from 1990 to 2019. The results confirmed the validity of the EKC hypothesis for G7 economies. Further, the result shows that environmental policy, green innovation, composite risk index, and renewable energy R&D help control carbon emissions. In contrast, income reveals a positive influence on environmental degradation. Furthermore, bidirectional causality has been reported in environmental policy, composite risk index, green innovation, and the CO2 emissions, while unidirectional causality running from GDP and renewable energy R&D to CO2 emissions. Based on the empirical findings, it is suggested that environmental policies should be strengthened, promote green innovation and renewable energy research and development expenditures, and political stability and institutional quality must be stabilized to lowers sectoral risks that would help a sustainable environment.

The Danjiang River Basin as an important source of water for the middle route of China?s South-toNorth Water Diversion Project, its water conservation function has attracted extensive public attention under global climate change. In this study, InVEST water yield model based on Budyko hydrological method was employed to analyze the spatio-temporal dynamics of water conservation, and the response of water conservation to climate, land use and soil changes for the period from 2000 to 2019. The results show that the water conservation of Danjiang River Basin tends to decrease under the comprehensive influence of various factors. The spatial analysis of the importance of water conservation identified Shangnan County, the southern part of Danfeng County and the northern part of Shanyang County as important water conservation areas in the study area, which should be regarded as the key and priority protection areas in the regional water resource and ecological protection. The study provides insights for sustainable water management and ecological protection policies, and the InVEST model with localized parameters can also be applied to other areas lacking climate, hydrological and geological data.

Recognizing the importance of innovation and financial sector development to environmental quality, several countries have embarked on identifying ways to improve environmental quality. However, studies on the tripartite linkages among innovation, financial development and pollution relationships have produced mixed findings. Furthermore, a plethora of the existing studies have relied on only carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions thus neglecting other anthropogenic activities which impact on the environment. More tellingly, how countries' levels of innovation moderate financial development-pollution link is yet to be studied. By relying on data from 27 selected industrialized countries spanning 1991-2014 in examining the tripartite relationships, we find that, while innovation lowers environmental pollution, beyond a certain threshold level, higher innovation exacerbates environmental degradation. Furthermore, while improved financial development increases pollution, higher innovation dampens the environmental quality-reducing effect of finance. Results from our panel causality tests also reveal a feedback causal linkage between innovation and ecological footprint, and a one-way causality from CO2 emissions to innovations. However, irrespective of the indicator of environmental pollution, financial development and pollution evolve independently, albeit differences at the country levels.

Being the largest carbon emitter, China's continuous economic growth may inevitably cause more carbon emissions in the future. To achieve carbon neutrality targets, the country is striving to promote cleaner technologies. However, to finance these environmentally friendly projects, a well-developed financial system is a pre-requisite. This study examines the role of financial development along with output, financial risk index, renewable energy electricity and human capital on carbon emissions. This study uses updated time series data from 1988 to 2018 for China employing novel econometric approaches, i.e., Narayan and Pop unit root test with structural breaks, Maki cointegration and frequency domain causality test for long, short and medium run causality. The empirical outcome shows that improvement in financial development, renewable energy electricity, and human capital index cause to limit carbon emissions. In contrast, gross domestic product, financial risk index and structural break of 2001 increase carbon emissions. Moreover, structural break year of 2008 and financial development index reduces carbon emissions. The negative association between financial development and carbon emissions supports the positive school of thoughts of financial development that promotes a sustainable environment. This study recommends the promotion of quality human capital and green financial development along with increasing the shares of renewable energy in electricity for achieving China 2030 climate targets of reducing pollution.

Improving our understanding of the propagation relationship between meteorological and hydrological drought is necessary to lessen drought impacts. The different drought responses and underlying mechanisms among different climate types are not yet sufficiently understood. By applying the standardized precipitation index and standardized runoff index, we investigated the propagation relationship between meteorological and hydrological drought. Because of shortterm response between meteorological and hydrological droughts, the propagation time was considered among time scales of 1-12 months. Wavelet analysis was employed to examine the two types of drought from 1902 to 2014. Our results showed that arid environments had a weaker propagation relationship than moist environments. There was a stronger relationship between the two types of drought in summer and autumn than in spring and winter. The climate was not the only factor impacting drought propagation; land (cover and topographic feature) may also impact propagation time and intensity from meteorological to hydrological drought. This study analyzed and highlighted that the most susceptible regions in China and global scale, respectively. The most susceptible regions were tropical and subtropical Chinese southern zones in China and equatorial and warm temperate climate zones in global; however, arid climate zones showed little interaction between the two kinds of drought. Other factors that impact drought propagation, such as land cover, landforms, and human activity, should be considered in future research.

In doing so, the present study aims to assess the role of eco-innovation and globalization in mitigating CO2 emissions in the case of the USA. The study applied Quantile Autoregressive Distributed Lag (QARDL) approach to estimate the short-run and long-run relationship among the selected variables. According to the empirical results, gross domestic product (GDP) positively influences the level of CO2 emissions for the USA economy at all quantiles. However, GDP square is negatively associated with CO2 emissions in the USA; therefore, our study supports the existence of EKC for the USA. Further, eco-innovation is the mitigating factor of CO2 emissions in our empirical analysis. Our study proved that globalization is the stimulating factor of CO2 emissions in the US economy. The empirical estimates of the Granger causality test show the bidirectional causality from GDP, eco-innovations, and globalization to GDP for the USA economy. To mitigate CO2 emissions, the study provides useful insights for policymakers in the USA economy.

It is a significant move by China to address climate issues and achieve its Carbon Neutrality target. Therefore, assessing the policy effects of carbon trading is fundamental to its implementation nationwide. Based on the panel data of 30 provinces and cities in China from 2008 to 2018, this paper uses the Synthetic Control Method and Differences-in-Differences method to assess the effects of carbon trading policy on achieving Carbon Neutrality. By measuring the net carbon emissions, this research explores the level of Carbon Neutrality in each region. Based on the Five-sphere Integrated Plan (which covers the economy, politics, culture, social and ecological civilization), this research further verifies the impact paths of carbon trading policy on Carbon Neutrality. The results show that: First, carbon trading policy has a significant and sustainable effect on Carbon Neutrality. Second, from the perspective of the Five-sphere Integrated Plan, the carbon trading policy can help to reduce carbon sources and increase carbon sinks by adjusting the industrial structure, coordinating low-carbon policies, promoting cultural dissemination, increasing green space construction, and reducing energy intensity to achieve Carbon Neutrality. Third, cultural construction plays the most significant role in mediating carbon trading and Carbon Neutrality, followed by political construction.

In recent years, this study area has been greatly influenced by several head-cut gullies due to unusual climatic factors and human induced activity. The present study is therefore intended to address this issue by developing head-cut gully erosion prediction maps using boosting ensemble machine learning algorithms, namely Boosted Tree (BT), Boosted Generalized Linear Models (BGLM), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and Deep Boost (DB). Initially, we produced a gully erosion inventory map using a variety of resources, including published reports, Google Earth images, and field records of the Global Positioning System (GPS). Subsequently, we distributed this information randomly and choose 70% (102) of the test gullies and the remaining 30% (43) for validation. The methodology was designed using morphometric and thematic determinants, including 14 head-cut gully erosion conditioning features. We have also investigated the following: (a) Multi-collinearity analysis to determine the linearity of the independent variables, (b) Predictive capability of piping models using train and test dataset and (c) Variables importance affecting head-cut gully erosion. The study reveals that altitude, land use, distances from road and soil characteristics influenced the method with the greatest impact on head-cut gully erosion susceptibility. We presented five head-cut gully erosion susceptibility maps and investigated their predictive accuracy through area under curve (AUC). The AUC test reveals that the DB machine learning method demonstrated significantly higher accuracy (AUC = 0.95) than the BT (AUC = 0.93), BGLM (AUC = 0.91), BRT (AUC = 0.94) and XGB (AUC = 0.92) approaches. The predicted head-cut gully erosion susceptibility maps can be used by policy makers and local authorities for soil conservation and to prevent threats to human activities.

J	Hao, Y; Niu, XS; Wang, JZ				Hao, Yan; Niu, Xinsong; Wang, Jianzhou			Impacts of haze pollution on China's tourism industry: A system of economic loss analysis	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Haze pollution; Optimal distribution; Economic loss; Optimization algorithm	EARLY-WARNING SYSTEM; AIR-QUALITY; OPTIMIZATION; POLLUTANTS; CLIMATE; MODEL	Haze pollution not only negatively influences public health but also causes great economic losses. However, most previous studies have mainly focused on health-related economic losses, while the negative effects of haze pollution on the tourism industry are often ignored, leading to the unsustainable development of tourism. In this context, contrasting with previous research perspectives, this article selected several representative tourist cities from East China, South China, Central China, North China, Northwest China, Southwest China, and Northeast China as research objects in an empirical study, developing an economic loss analysis system to quantitatively evaluate the losses in the tourism industry caused by haze pollution. This system uses the satin bower bird optimization-based distribution estimation method to identify the optimal distribution of haze pollution, demonstrating superior performance to the traditional estimation method. Meanwhile, the optimal distribution of haze pollution is employed to measure the probability of different concentration limits in each area. Furthermore, the economic loss formula of the tourism industry is proposed in the devised system, calculating the economic loss caused by haze pollution at different degrees. The results show that haze pollution in different degrees has caused varying degrees of losses to China's tourism industry. In terms of seasonality and regionality, different seasons and different regions produce different results. Compared with summer, autumn and winter haze pollution is more severe, creating obvious seasonal differences. There is also a regional agglomeration effect, whereby the regional distribution of haze pollution is consistent with each region's economic development.

The causal effect on firm performance of China's financing-pollution emission reduction policy: Firm-level evidence	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Financial-emission reduction policy; Firm performance; Financial constraints; Difference-in-difference	ENVIRONMENTAL-REGULATION; CLEAN PRODUCTION; GREEN CREDIT; PRODUCTIVITY; CONSTRAINTS; INVESTMENT; HYPOTHESIS; GROWTH; IMPACT; TAX	The relationship between pollution emissions and economic development matters greatly to sustainable growth goals. China has experienced rapid growth in pollution emissions, energy consumption, and the effects of climate change. To achieve pollution reduction and energy savings targets, China's green loan policy implements a financing-pollution emissions reduction strategy for Chinese firms. Employing a difference-in-difference estimation method, we use Jiangsu Province manufacturing firm data for the period 2005 to 2013 to evaluate the effect of financing-pollution emission reduction policy tools on firm performance. Our analysis yields the following results. First, the financing-emission reduction policy has a "punishment" effect on highly polluting firm performance, including total factor productivity, profitability, and sales growth. Second, we find that these negative effects are weakened in dynamic processes. Further, pollution emissions are significantly reduced. Third, financial constraints act as the mechanism through which firm performance is punished, via the financial-emission reduction policy. Short-term and long-term bank financing decrease, while working capital and trade credit are increased to finance investment. Finally, with regard to ownership structure, state-owned firm performance is more likely to be penalized than other forms of ownership.

The overall performance of the electric vehicle is highly dependent on the electricity mix consumed during their production and use phase. Therefore, a comprehensive and dynamic assessment is necessary to provide accurate guidance to users and policymakers. Therefore, this study presents a comparative cradle to grave life cycle analysis of electric vehicles in 10 selected countries using the current and future electricity mix scenarios. We present the environmental footprint of vehicle production, transportation, and use phases. The results revealed that EVs in China with current (2019) and future 2025 electricity mix scenarios had a higher impact than all other EVs. In contrast, EV with 2030 Norway electricity mix was an optimal choice and has the least environmental impact in most of the selected categories. Moreover, it was also found that all EVs with 2030 electricity mix had lower environmental damages than EV 2019 electricity mix. Besides, this study outcome indicated that the use of clean energy could help to decrease the environmental impact and mitigate climate change all around the globe.

Previous studies on the adoption of agricultural innovation often consider socioeconomic characteristics and overlook underlying psychological factors influencing farmers' behavioral intention. This study adopted three socio-psychological constructs, Attitude, Subjective Norm (SN), and Perceived Behavioral Control (PBC), which originated from the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), and proposed two new constructs, Knowledge (K) and Perceived Climatic Threats of Conventional Farming (PCTCV). Using the Extended Theory of Planned Behavior Model (ETPBM), this study analyzed factors affecting the intention of farmers to continue Conservation Agriculture (CA) for the following year (2020) in three districts located in the northern part of Bangladesh. This research found evidence from the hierarchical regression analysis that variables of ETPBM could explain 7% more variation (change in R-2) in intention than variables of TPB, while the socio-economic characteristics of farmers can explain only 0.5% more than the variables of ETPBM. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was used to determine and examine the extended theory and indicated that farmers' knowledge (K) had the highest total impact, while attitude had the highest direct impact on intention. The results indicated that factors including Attitude, SN, PBC, Knowledge (K), and PCTCV are positively significant when attempting to understand farmers' intentions to adopt CA. This study presented evidence about the effectiveness of ETPBM when assessing the farmers' intentions towards conservation farming. Based on these findings, we concluded that the combination of extension services for upgrading the level of knowledge concerning the importance of CA could significantly affect farmers' attitudes on intention towards the application of CA.

Mapping the spatial and temporal variability of flood hazard affected by climate and land-use changes in the future	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Climate change; Ensemble approach; Flood risk; Land-use change; Machine learning	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; ERROR PRUNING TREES; WEST-BENGAL; SUSCEPTIBILITY; RISK; IMPACTS; MODEL; RIVER; PRECIPITATION; SCENARIOS	The predicts current and future flood risk in the Kalvan watershed of northwestern Markazi Province, Iran. To do this, 512 flood and non-flood locations were identified and mapped. Twenty flood-risk factors were selected to model flood risk using several machine learning techniques: conditional inference random forest (CIRF), the gradient boosting model (GBM), extreme gradient boosting (XGB) and their ensembles. To investigate the future (year 2050) effects of changing climates and changing land use on future flood risk, a general circulation model (GCM) with representative concentration pathways (RCPs) of the 2.6 and 8.5 scenarios by 2050 was tested for impacts on 8 precipitation variables. In addition, future land uses in 2050 was prepared using a CA-Markov model. The performances of the flood risk models were validated with Receiver Operating Characteristic-Area Under Curve (ROC-AUC) and other statistical analyses. The AUC value of the ROC curve indicates that the ensemble model had the highest predictive power (AUC = 0.83) and was followed by GBM (AUC = 0.80), XGB (AUC = 0.79), and CIRF (AUC = 0.78). The results of climate and land use changes on future flood-prone areas showed that the areas classified as having moderate to very high flood risk will increase by 2050. Due to the changes occurring with land uses and in climates, the area classified as moderate to very high risk increased in the predictions from all four models. The areal proportion classes of the risk zones in 2050 under the RCP 2.6 scenario using the ensemble model have changed of the following proportions from the current distribution Very Low =-12.04 %, Low =-8.56 %, Moderate = +1.56 %, High = +11.55 %, and Very High = +7.49 %. The RCP 8.5 scenario has caused the following changes from the present percentages: Very Low =-14.48 %, Low =-6.35 %, Moderate = +4.54 %, High = +10.61 %, and Very High = +5.67 %. The results of current and future flood risk mapping can aid planners and flood hazard managers in their efforts to mitigate impacts.

J	Dikshit, A; Pradhan, B; Huete, A				Dikshit, Abhirup; Pradhan, Biswajeet; Huete, Alfredo			An improved SPEI drought forecasting approach using the long short-term memory neural network	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Standard precipitation evaporation index; New South Wales; Drought forecasting; Deep learning	NEW-SOUTH-WALES; MACHINE; MODEL; WAVELET	Droughts are slow-moving natural hazards that gradually spread over large areas and capable of extending to continental scales, leading to severe socio-economic damage. A key challenge is developing accurate drought forecast model and understanding a models' capability to examine different drought characteristics. Traditionally, forecasting techniques have used various time-series approaches and machine learning models. However, the use of deep learning methods have not been tested extensively despite its potential to improve our understanding of drought characteristics. The present study uses a deep learning approach, specifically the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to predict a commonly used drought measure, the Standard Precipitation Evaporation Index (SPEI) at two different time scales (SPEI 1, SPEI 3). The model was compared with other common machine learning method, Random Forests, Artificial Neural Networks and applied over the New South Wales (NSW) region of Australia, using hydro-meteorological variables as predictors. The drought index and predictor data were collected from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) dataset spanning from 1901 to 2018. We analysed the LSTM forecasted results in terms of several drought characteristics (drought intensity, drought category, or spatial variation) to better understand how drought forecasting was improved. Evaluation of the drought intensity forecasting capabilities of the model were based on three different statistical metrics, Coefficient of Determination (R-2), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The model achieved R-2 value of more than 0.99 for both SPEI 1 and SPEI 3 cases. The variation in drought category forecasted results were studied using a multi-class Receiver Operating Characteristic based Area under Curves (ROC-AUC) approach. The analysis revealed an AUC value of 0.83 and 0.82 for SPEI 1 and SPEI 3 respectively. The spatial variation between observed and forecasted values were analysed for the summer months of 2016-2018. The findings from the study show an improvement relative to machine learning models for a lead time of 1 month in terms of different drought characteristics. The results from this work can be used for drought mitigation purposes and different models need to be tested to further enhance our capabilities.

We hypothesize the existence of an inverse U-shaped curve, which differs by industry and provincial level of development. In that context, we test for a quadratic relationship between accepted patents and CO2 emissions per capita in 30 provinces and 32 economic sectors of China. We use a novel fixed effect panel data quantile (FEQR) regression estimator and differentiate between energy-intensive and non-energy intensive sectors, as well as between more and less-developed provinces of China. We find evidence for an inverse Ushaped relation between patent generation and CO2 emissions for both, more and less energy-intensive sectors, suggesting that at low levels of innovation new technologies tend to be "dirty", but at high levels of innovation new technologies tend to be "green". The same relationship holds for less-developed provinces as well. For moredeveloped provinces, we find the opposite relation, which we explain with a "rebound effect".

The mechanism of using straw biochar for soil improvement is different under various climate and soil texture conditions. To explore the mechanism of using straw biochar to improve soil and its influence on crop yield in the typical arid and semi-arid, a large temperature difference between day and night, soil temperature at different depths, and physiological changes and crop yield of maize at different growth stages were studied. It is assumed that straw biochar can improve the properties of salinized soil including physicochemical indexes, and crop physiological index, stimulates the positive circulation between soil, vegetation, and microorganisms, and plays a role in improving soil quality. The results showed that biochar application increased the average soil temperature (T) by 2 degrees C and reduced day-night T differences. Application of 30 t/ha biochar increased the average maize leaf T by 2.2 degrees C and photosynthetic rate by 16.5%. Furthermore, the average transpiration rate doubled compared to control, and the chlorophyll value increased by 21%. The application of biochar improved the utilization rate of nitrogen fertilizer by enhancing ammonification. Biochar application caused a maximum overall yield increase of 11.9% compared to control treatment (CK). Therefore, these results provide a practical basis for improving weakly alkaline farmland soils in arid and semi-arid areas, and provide an effective method to potentially mitigate the environmental crisis and promote sustainable development in agriculture.

It is important to strengthen research in ESs and social sustainable development to identify the main driving factors of different ESs. This study assessed carbon sequestration (CS), water yield (WY) and soil conservation (SC) from 2000 to 2018 in the Loess Plateau using CASA (The Carnegie-AmesStanford Approach), InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs) and RUSLE (Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation) models. The spatial heterogeneity, trade-offs and synergies and driving factors were explored in the whole Loess Plateau. The results showed that the WY, CS and SC had increased from 2000 to 2018. The spatial relationships between WY and SC, SC and CS, and WY and CS were mainly synergistic. Annual mean precipitation (MAP) was the dominant driving factor of WY, while normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and slope (SL) had the strongest explanatory power for CS and SC. The LU was the most critical factor affecting the ESs in the different climatic zones. These results could act as a reference for decision-makers on how to control various influencing factors of ESs to improve the local ecology under local conditions.

Spatiotemporal nexus between vegetation change and extreme climatic indices and their possible causes of change	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Normalized difference vegetation index; Mortlet wavelet; Detrended fluctuation analysis; Global warming; Extreme events; Bangladesh	TEMPERATURE EXTREMES; PRECIPITATION EVENTS; CHINA; PLATEAU; PRODUCTIVITY; VARIABILITY; BANGLADESH; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS; TRENDS	Climate extremes have a significant impact on vegetation. However, little is known about vegetation response to climatic extremes in Bangladesh. The association of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) with nine extreme precipitation and temperature indices was evaluated to identify the nexus between vegetation and climatic extremes and their associations in Bangladesh for the period 1986?2017. Moreover, detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and Morlet wavelet analysis (MWA) were employed to evaluate the possible future trends and decipher the existing periodic cycles, respectively in the time series of NDVI and climate extremes. Besides, atmospheric variables of ECMWF ERA5 were used to examine the casual circulation mechanism responsible for climatic extremes of Bangladesh. The results revealed that the monthly NDVI is positively associated with extreme rainfall with spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Warm temperature indices showed a significant negative association with NDVI on the seasonal scale, while precipitation and cold temperature extremes showed a positive association with yearly NDVI. The DEA revealed a continuous increase in temperature extreme in the future, while no change in precipitation extremes. NDVI also revealed a significant association with extreme temperature indices with a time lag of one month and with precipitation extreme without time lag. Spatial analysis indicated insensitivity of marshy vegetation type to climate extremes in winter. The study revealed that elevated summer geopotential height, no visible anticyclonic center, reduced high cloud cover, and low solar radiation with higher humidity contributed to climatic extremes in Bangladesh. The nexus between NDVI and climatic extremes established in this study indicated that increasing warm temperature extremes due to global warming might have severe implications on Bangladesh?s ecology and the environment in the future.

Different from the existing research, this paper studied the separate influence of internal and external input structural changes on global carbon emissions. We applied structural decomposition analysis (SDA) to decompose the global carbon emission change into six factors: namely, the carbon emission intensity, the domestic input structure, the international input structure, consumption pattern, consumption volume and population. The results firstly showed that the contributions of different factors to global carbon emissions changed over time. In recent five years, structural changes of domestic inputs became the principle driver of decrease in global carbon emissions. Secondly, the results showed that there were significant differences for countries in their factors for carbon emissions. In India and Russia, domestic input structural change was the major contributor to the decrease in carbon emissions. In Japan and Germany, the most important factor for the increase in carbon emissions was the international input structure. Finally, the results showed the factors for carbon emission changes were correlated to economic development. The international input structural changes significantly increased carbon emissions in high-income countries. Our findings suggested that some countries such as India and Russia, improving the usage efficiency of domestic carbon-intensive products would help reducing carbon emissions. For most high-income countries such as Japan and Germany, they should reduce the dependence on the imported carbon-intensive products by turning the external input sources to countries with technology advantages. In addition, technology exportation of high-income countries would also be beneficial for the global carbon reduction.
