In recent decades, the warming in the Arctic has been much faster than in the rest of the world, a phenomenon known as Arctic amplification. Numerous studies report that the Arctic is warming either twice, more than twice, or even three times as fast as the globe on average. Here we show, by using several observational datasets which cover the Arctic region, that during the last 43 years the Arctic has been warming nearly four times faster than the globe, which is a higher ratio than generally reported in literature. We compared the observed Arctic amplification ratio with the ratio simulated by state-of-the-art climate models, and found that the observed four-fold warming ratio over 1979-2021 is an extremely rare occasion in the climate model simulations. The observed and simulated amplification ratios are more consistent with each other if calculated over a longer period; however the comparison is obscured by observational uncertainties before 1979. Our results indicate that the recent four-fold Arctic warming ratio is either an extremely unlikely event, or the climate models systematically tend to underestimate the amplification.

Here, we conduct a statistical analysis on a global dataset extracted from the Harmful Algae Event Database and Ocean Biodiversity Information System for the period 1985-2018 to investigate temporal trends in the frequency and distribution of marine harmful algal blooms. We find no uniform global trend in the number of harmful algal events and their distribution over time, once data were adjusted for regional variations in monitoring effort. Varying and contrasting regional trends were driven by differences in bloom species, type and emergent impacts. Our findings suggest that intensified monitoring efforts associated with increased aquaculture production are responsible for the perceived increase in harmful algae events and that there is no empirical support for broad statements regarding increasing global trends. Instead, trends need to be considered regionally and at the species level. The global occurrence of harmful algal bloom events is not increasing uniformly over time and the increase in recorded events is due to enhanced coastal monitoring and aquaculture, according to an analysis of a 33-year global dataset.

Country-based rate of emissions reductions should increase by 80% beyond nationally determined contributions to meet the 2 degrees C target	COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							CARBON BUDGET; PARIS; DEFORESTATION; FORESTATION	The 2015 Paris Agreement aims to keep global warming by 2100 to below 2 degrees C, with 1.5 degrees C as a target. To that end, countries agreed to reduce their emissions by nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Using a fully statistically based probabilistic framework, we find that the probabilities of meeting their nationally determined contributions for the largest emitters are low, e.g. 2% for the USA and 16% for China. On current trends, the probability of staying below 2 degrees C of warming is only 5%, but if all countries meet their nationally determined contributions and continue to reduce emissions at the same rate after 2030, it rises to 26%. If the USA alone does not meet its nationally determined contribution, it declines to 18%. To have an even chance of staying below 2 degrees C, the average rate of decline in emissions would need to increase from the 1% per year needed to meet the nationally determined contributions, to 1.8% per year. The probability of not exceeding the 2 degrees C climate warming target if all countries meet their nationally determined contributions and continue to reduce emissions lies at around 26%, according to an analysis with a statistically-based probabilistic framework.

Projected increases in western US forest fire despite growing fuel constraints	COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							ANTHROPOGENIC CLIMATE-CHANGE; WILDLAND FIRE; BURN SEVERITY; WILDFIRE; VEGETATION; LIKELIHOOD; WEATHER; REGIMES	Escalating burned area in western US forests punctuated by the 2020 fire season has heightened the need to explore near-term macroscale forest-fire area trajectories. As fires remove fuels for subsequent fires, feedbacks may impose constraints on the otherwise climate-driven trend of increasing forest-fire area. Here, we test how fire-fuel feedbacks moderate near-term (2021-2050) climate-driven increases in forest-fire area across the western US. Assuming constant fuels, climate-fire models project a doubling of forest-fire area compared to 1991-2020. Fire-fuel feedbacks only modestly attenuate the projected increase in forest-fire area. Even models with strong feedbacks project increasing interannual variability in forest-fire area and more than a two-fold increase in the likelihood of years exceeding the 2020 fire season. Fuel limitations from fire-fuel feedbacks are unlikely to strongly constrain the profound climate-driven broad-scale increases in forest-fire area by the mid-21st century, highlighting the need for proactive adaptation to increased western US forest-fire impacts. Reduced fuel availability will only moderately diminish projected near-term increases in climate-driven forest fire area in the Western US, according to a macroscale climate-fire model.

Cleaner burning aviation fuels can reduce contrail cloudiness	COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							PARTICULATE-EMISSIONS; SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS; CIRRUS; AEROSOL; SPECTROMETER; PERFORMANCE; CALIBRATION; TRANSITION; NUMBER; IMPACT	Burning sustainable aviation fuel blends with low levels of soot-producing aromatic components can result in a 50 to 70% reduction in soot and ice number concentrations and an increase in ice crystal size, suggest measurements of exhaust and contrail characteristics in two aircraft campaigns. Contrail cirrus account for the major share of aviation's climate impact. Yet, the links between jet fuel composition, contrail microphysics and climate impact remain unresolved. Here we present unique observations from two DLR-NASA aircraft campaigns that measured exhaust and contrail characteristics of an Airbus A320 burning either standard jet fuels or low aromatic sustainable aviation fuel blends. Our results show that soot particles can regulate the number of contrail cirrus ice crystals for current emission levels. We provide experimental evidence that burning low aromatic sustainable aviation fuel can result in a 50 to 70% reduction in soot and ice number concentrations and an increase in ice crystal size. Reduced contrail ice numbers cause less energy deposition in the atmosphere and less warming. Meaningful reductions in aviation's climate impact could therefore be obtained from the widespread adoptation of low aromatic fuels, and from regulations to lower the maximum aromatic fuel content.

J	van der Wiel, K; Bintanja, R				van der Wiel, Karin; Bintanja, Richard			Contribution of climatic changes in mean and variability to monthly temperature and precipitation extremes	COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							SEA-ICE; HEAT WAVES; DEGREES-C; EVENTS; MODEL; PROJECTIONS	The frequency of climate extremes will change in response to shifts in both mean climate and climate variability. These individual contributions, and thus the fundamental mechanisms behind changes in climate extremes, remain largely unknown. Here we apply the probability ratio concept in large-ensemble climate simulations to attribute changes in extreme events to either changes in mean climate or climate variability. We show that increased occurrence of monthly high-temperature events is governed by a warming mean climate. In contrast, future changes in monthly heavy-precipitation events depend to a considerable degree on trends in climate variability. Spatial variations are substantial however, highlighting the relevance of regional processes. The contributions of mean and variability to the probability ratio are largely independent of event threshold, magnitude of warming and climate model. Hence projections of temperature extremes are more robust than those of precipitation extremes, since the mean climate is better understood than climate variability. Changes in monthly temperature extremes are governed by mean climate warming, whereas changes in monthly precipitation extremes respond more to changes in variability, suggest analyses of large-ensemble climate simulations.

We estimate a median TCRE of 0.44 degrees C and 5-95% range of 0.32-0.62 degrees C per 1000 GtCO(2) emitted. Considering only geophysical uncertainties, our median estimate of the 1.5 degrees C remaining carbon budget is 440 GtCO(2) from 2020 onwards, with a range of 230-670 GtCO(2), (for a 67-33% chance of not exceeding the target). Additional socioeconomic uncertainty related to human decisions regarding future non-CO2 emissions scenarios can further shift the median 1.5 degrees C remaining carbon budget by 170 GtCO(2). Integrating uncertainties using insights from both observations and models narrows the range on the remaining carbon budget for 1.5 degrees C, as well as the transient climate response to cumulative CO2 emissions.

Previous studies attributed this intensification to an increase in mean SST and moisture convergence over the central-to-eastern Pacific, without explicitly considering underlying nonlinear SST-rainfall relationship changes. Here, by analyzing changes of the tropical SST-rainfall relationship of CMIP6 models, we present a mechanism linking the mean SST rise to amplifying ENSO-rainfall variability. We show that the slope of the SST-rainfall function over Nino3 region becomes steeper in a warmer climate, similar to 42.1% increase in 2050-2099 relative to 1950-1999, due to the increase in Clausius-Clapeyron-driven moisture sensitivity, similar to 16.2%, and dynamic contributions, similar to 25.9%. A theoretical reconstruction of ENSO-rainfall variability further supports this mechanism. Our results imply ENSO's hydrological impacts increase nonlinearly in response to global warming.

Isotopes (delta N-15, delta O-18) help unravel spatiotemporal nitrogen(N)-cycling of aquatic nitrate (NO3-). We synthesized nitrate isotope data (n=similar to 5200) for global rivers and shallow aquifers for common patterns and processes. Rivers had lower median NO3- (0.30.2mgL(-1), n=2902) compared to aquifers (5.5 +/- 5.1mgL(-1), n=2291) and slightly lower delta N-15 values (+7.1 +/- 3.8 parts per thousand, n=2902 vs +7.7 +/- 4.5 parts per thousand, n=2291), but were indistinguishable in delta O-18 (+2.3 +/- 6.2 parts per thousand, n=2790 vs +2.3 +/- 5.4 parts per thousand, n=2235). The isotope composition of NO3- was correlated with water temperature revealing enhanced N-cascading in warmer climates. Seasonal analyses revealed higher delta N-15 and delta O-18 values in wintertime, suggesting waste-related N-source signals are better preserved in the cold seasons. Isotopic assays of nitrate biogeochemical transformations are key to understanding nitrate pollution and to inform beneficial agricultural and land management strategies.

J	Mi, ZF; Sun, XL				Mi, Zhifu; Sun, Xinlu			Provinces with transitions in industrial structure and energy mix performed best in climate change mitigation in China	COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							CARBON EMISSIONS; CO2 EMISSIONS; POLICY; AGREEMENT; IMPACT	China has announced its goal of reaching carbon neutrality before 2060, which will be challenging because the country is still on a path towards peak carbon emissions in approximately 2030. Carbon emissions in China did decline from 2013 to 2016, following a continuous increase since the turn of the century. Here we evaluate regional efforts and motivations in promoting carbon emission reduction during this period. Based on a climate change mitigation index, we pinpoint the leading and lagging provinces in emission reduction. The results show that achievements in industrial transition and non-fossil fuel development determined the leading provinces. Thus, the recommended solution for carbon neutrality in China is to promote the transformation of industrial structure and energy mix. In addition, policymakers should be alert to the path of energy outsourcing to reduce carbon emissions. Consumption-based emissions accounting and interregional cooperation are suggested to motivate developed regions to take more responsibility for climate change mitigation. A targeted focus on a transition of industrial structure and energy mix is the most promising pathway to achieving CO2 neutrality in China by 2060, suggests an analysis at the provincial level of achievements in emission reductions during 2013-16.

Historically, there is little evidence for systematic increases in flood magnitude despite observed increases in precipitation extremes. Here we investigate how flood magnitudes change in response to warming, using a large initial-condition ensemble of simulations with a single climate model, coupled to a hydrological model. The model chain was applied to historical (1961-2000) and warmer future (2060-2099) climate conditions for 78 watersheds in hydrological Bavaria, a region comprising the headwater catchments of the Inn, Danube and Main River, thus representing an area of expressed hydrological heterogeneity. For the majority of the catchments, we identify a 'return interval threshold' in the relationship between precipitation and flood increases: at return intervals above this threshold, further increases in extreme precipitation frequency and magnitude clearly yield increased flood magnitudes; below the threshold, flood magnitude is modulated by land surface processes. We suggest that this threshold behaviour can reconcile climatological and hydrological perspectives on changing flood risk in a warming climate.

Much uncertainty remains in the future mass loss of the Greenland Ice Sheet due to the challenges of capturing the ice dynamic response to climate change in numerical models. Here, we estimate the sea level contribution of the Greenland Ice Sheet over the 21st century using an ice-sheet wide, high-resolution, ice-ocean numerical model that includes surface mass balance forcing, thermal forcing from the ocean, and iceberg calving dynamics. The model is calibrated with ice front observations from the past eleven years to capture the recent evolution of marine-terminating glaciers. Under a business as usual scenario, we find that northwest and central west Greenland glaciers will contribute more mass loss than other regions due to ice front retreat and ice flow acceleration. By the end of century, ice discharge from marine-terminating glaciers will contribute 5020% of the total mass loss, or twice as much as previously estimated although the contribution from the surface mass balance increases towards the end of the century. Changes in ice dynamics in the Greenland Ice Sheet are projected to contribute to significantly more mass loss than previously thought, suggesting that proper calibration and accurate representation of ice-ocean interactions are critical.

Terrestrial vegetation sequesters 112-169 PgC (1PgC = 10(15)g carbon) each year, which plays a vital role in global carbon recycling. Vegetation carbon sequestration varies under different land management practices. Here we propose an integrated method to assess how much more carbon can be sequestered by vegetation if optimal land management practices get implemented. The proposed method combines remotely sensed time-series of net primary productivity datasets, segmented landscape-vegetation-soil zones, and distance-constrained zonal analysis. We find that the global land vegetation can sequester an extra of 13.74 PgC per year if location-specific optimal land management practices are taken and half of the extra clusters in similar to 15% of vegetated areas. The finding suggests optimizing land management is a promising way to mitigate climate changes.

However, how climate change will affect ecosystem representation within the protected area network remains unclear. Here we use spatial climate analogs to examine potential climate-driven shifts in terrestrial ecoregions and biomes under a +2 degrees C warming scenario and associated implications for achieving 30% area-based protection targets. We find that roughly half of land area will experience climate conditions that correspond with different ecoregions and nearly a quarter will experience climates from a different biome. Of the area projected to remain climatically stable, 46% is currently intact (low human modification). The area required to achieve protection targets in 87% of ecoregions exceeds the area that is intact, not protected, and projected to remain climatically stable within those ecoregions. Therefore, we propose that prioritization schemes will need to explicitly consider climate-driven changes in patterns of biodiversity. Preservation of biodiversity by expanding protected areas is complicated by expected climate change that could dissociate ecoregion or biome from climate conditions in over half of land area, according to analyses of spatial climate analogs	[Dobrowski, Solomon Z.; Lyons, Drew S.; Hollenberg, Clark] Univ Montana, Dept Forest Management, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Littlefield, Caitlin E.] Univ Vermont, Rubenstein Sch Environm & Nat Resources, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Littlefield, Caitlin E.] Conservat Sci Partners, 11050 Pioneer Trail, Truckee, CA 96161 USA; [Carroll, Carlos] Klamath Ctr Conservat Res, Orleans, CA 95556 USA; [Parks, Sean A.] US Forest Serv, Aldo Leopold Wilderness Res Inst, Rocky Mt Res Stn, USDA, Missoula, MT 59801 USA; [Abatzoglou, John T.] Univ Calif Merced, Coll Engn, Management Complex Syst, Merced, CA 95343 USA; [Hegewisch, Katherine] Univ Calif Merced, Sierra Nevada Res Inst, Merced, CA 95343 USA; [Gage, Josh] Gage Cartograph, Bozeman, MT USA	University of Montana System; University of Montana; University of Vermont; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; University of California System; University of California Merced; University of California System; University of California Merced	Dobrowski, SZ (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Dept Forest Management, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.	solomon.dobrowski@umontana.edu	Dobrowski, Solomon Z/Q-7132-2019; Abatzoglou, John T/C-7635-2012	Dobrowski, Solomon Z/0000-0003-2561-3850; Abatzoglou, John T/0000-0001-7599-9750; Lyons, Drew/0000-0002-3993-0155; Carroll, Carlos/0000-0002-7697-8721; Parks, Sean/0000-0002-2982-5255	USDA Forest Service; Rocky Mountain Research Station; Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute; NASA [80NSSC19K00181]; Google	USDA Forest Service(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service); Rocky Mountain Research Station(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service); Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute; NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); Google(Google Incorporated)	This research was supported in part by the USDA Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute.

Past megadroughts in central Europe were longer, more severe and less warm than modern droughts	COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							NORTH-ATLANTIC; CLIMATE VARIABILITY; TEMPERATURE; IMPACTS; REANALYSIS; DATABASE; GERMANY	Megadroughts are notable manifestations of the American Southwest, but not so much of the European climate. By using long-term hydrological and meteorological observations, as well as paleoclimate reconstructions, here we show that central Europe has experienced much longer and severe droughts during the Sporer Minimum (similar to AD 1400-1480) and Dalton Minimum (similar to AD 1770-1840), than the ones observed during the 21st century. These two megadroughts appear to be linked with a cold state of the North Atlantic Ocean and enhanced winter atmospheric blocking activity over the British Isles and western part of Europe, concurrent with reduced solar forcing and explosive volcanism. Moreover, we show that the recent drought events (e.g., 2003, 2015, and 2018), are within the range of natural variability and they are not unprecedented over the last millennium.

Here we forced the physical lake model Simstrat with locally downscaled climate models under three future scenarios to investigate the impact on 29 Swiss lakes, varying in size along an altitudinal gradient. Results from the worst-case scenario project substantial change at the end of the century in duration of ice-cover at mid to high altitude (-2 to -107 days), stratification duration (winter -17 to -84 days, summer -2 to 73 days), while lower and especially mid altitude (present day mean annual air temperature from 9 degrees C to 3 degrees C) dimictic lakes risk shift to monomictic regimes (seven out of the eight lakes). Analysis further indicates that for many lakes shifts in mixing regime can be avoided by adhering to the most stringent scenario.

Training machine learning models on climate model output yields skillful interpretable seasonal precipitation forecasts	COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							WINTER PRECIPITATION; SURFACE-TEMPERATURE; ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS; PREDICTIVE SKILL; ENSO; TELECONNECTIONS; VARIABILITY	Seasonal forecasting skill in machine learning methods that are trained on large climate model ensembles can compete with, or out-compete, existing dynamical models, while retaining physical interpretability. A barrier to utilizing machine learning in seasonal forecasting applications is the limited sample size of observational data for model training. To circumvent this issue, here we explore the feasibility of training various machine learning approaches on a large climate model ensemble, providing a long training set with physically consistent model realizations. After training on thousands of seasons of climate model simulations, the machine learning models are tested for producing seasonal forecasts across the historical observational period (1980-2020). For forecasting large-scale spatial patterns of precipitation across the western United States, here we show that these machine learning-based models are capable of competing with or outperforming existing dynamical models from the North American Multi Model Ensemble. We further show that this approach need not be considered a 'black box' by utilizing machine learning interpretability methods to identify the relevant physical processes that lead to prediction skill.

Anomalous behavior of the Arctic stratospheric polar vortex provides an important source of subseasonal-to-seasonal predictability of Northern Hemisphere cold air outbreaks. Here, through reanalysis data for the period 1958-2019 and climate model simulations for preindustrial conditions, we show that weak stratospheric polar vortex conditions increase the risk of severe cold air outbreaks in mid-latitude East Asia by 100%, in contrast to only 40% for moderate cold air outbreaks. Such a disproportionate increase is also found in Europe, with an elevated risk persisting more than three weeks. By analysing the stream of polar cold air mass, we show that the polar vortex affects severe cold air outbreaks by modifying the inter-hemispheric transport of cold air mass. Using a novel method to assess Granger causality, we show that the polar vortex provides predictive information regarding severe cold air outbreaks over multiple regions in the Northern Hemisphere, which may help with mitigating their impact. A weak stratospheric polar vortex in the Arctic leads to a disproportionally increased risk of severe cold air outbreaks over northern extratropical regions, compared to moderate outbreaks, suggest analyses of reanalysis data and climate model simulations.

Nature-based climate solutions, which aim to preserve and enhance carbon storage in terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems, could be a potential contributor to net-zero emissions targets. However, there is a risk that successfully stored land carbon could be subsequently lost back to the atmosphere as a result of disturbances such as wildfire or deforestation. Here we quantify the climate effect of nature-based climate solutions in a scenario where land-based carbon storage is enhanced over the next several decades, and then returned to the atmosphere during the second half of this century. We show that temporary carbon sequestration has the potential to decrease the peak temperature increase, but only if implemented alongside an ambitious mitigation scenario where fossil fuel CO2 emissions were also decreased to net-zero. We also show that non-CO2 effects such as surface albedo decreases associated with reforestation could counter almost half of the climate effect of carbon sequestration. Our results suggest that there is climate benefit associated with temporary nature-based carbon storage, but only if implemented as a complement (and not an alternative) to ambitious fossil fuel CO2 emissions reductions. Temporarily enhanced terrestrial carbon storage through nature based climate solutions can reduce the peak global temperature increase only when complemented by ambitious emissions reductions, according to simulations with an intermediate complexity climate model.

Here we combined global crop yield and environmental data in a -1-million-dimensional mathematical optimisation framework to determine how optimising the spatial distribution of global croplands could reduce environmental impacts whilst maintaining current crop production levels. We estimate that relocating current croplands to optimal locations, whilst allowing ecosystems in then-abandoned areas to regenerate, could simultaneously decrease the current carbon, biodiversity, and irrigation water footprint of global crop production by 71%, 87%, and 100%, respectively, assuming high-input farming on newly established sites. The optimal global distribution of crops is largely similar for current and end-of-century climatic conditions across emission scenarios. Substantial impact reductions could already be achieved by relocating only a small proportion of worldwide crop production, relocating croplands only within national borders, and assuming less intensive farming systems.

Deforestation and climate change are projected to increase heat stress risk in the Brazilian Amazon	COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							BIOSPHERE MODEL; CMIP5; PERFORMANCE	Complete savannization of the Amazon Basin would enhance the effects of climate change on local heat exposure and pose a risk to human health, according to climate model projections. Land use change and deforestation can influence local temperature and climate. Here we use a coupled ocean-atmosphere model to assess the impact of savannization of the Amazon Basin on the wet-bulb globe temperature heat stress index under two climate change scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). We find that heat stress exposure due to deforestation was comparable to the effect of climate change under RCP8.5. Our findings suggest that heat stress index could exceed the human adaptation limit by 2100 under the combined effects of Amazon savannization and climate change. Moreover, we find that risk of heat stress exposure was highest in Northern Brazil and among the most socially vulnerable. We suggest that by 2100, savannization of the Amazon will lead to more than 11 million people will be exposed heat stress that poses an extreme risk to human health under a high emission scenario.

There are many potential options for reducing or even eliminating atmospheric CO2 emissions including underground sequestration, carbon mineralization and ocean storage. One of the most promising materials for carbon mineralization is Mg(OH)(2) which is highly reactive and capable of forming stable carbonates. Here we show a novel low-carbon method of producing Mg(OH)(2), from globally abundant olivine-rich silicate rocks. A combination of acid digestion and electrolysis of olivine were used to produce Mg(OH)(2) in a fully recoverable system. The use of Mg(OH)(2) from olivine provides a viable pathway for significant industrial scale reductions in global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Magnesium hydroxide is a sustainable material for CO2 sequestration, according to an acid digestion and electrolysis method using olivine-rich silicate rocks in a fully recoverable system.

Here, using an atmospheric river detection algorithm along with a regional climate model and satellite observations, we show that the most intense atmospheric rivers induce extremes in temperature, surface melt, sea-ice disintegration, or large swells that destabilize the ice shelves with 40% probability. This was observed during the collapses of the Larsen A and B ice shelves during the summers of 1995 and 2002 respectively. Overall, 60% of calving events from 2000-2020 were triggered by atmospheric rivers. The loss of the buttressing effect from these ice shelves leads to further continental ice loss and subsequent sea-level rise. Under future warming projections, the Larsen C ice shelf will be at-risk from the same processes.

Here, we combine datasets derived from sustained ocean observing systems (satellite and in situ), idealized observation-based modelling (advection-diffusion of a passive tracer), and a machine learning technique (ocean profile clustering) to document and explain the most-recent and ongoing cooling-to-warming transition of the Subpolar North Atlantic. Following a gradual cooling of the region that was persisting since 2006, a surface-intensified and large-scale warming sharply emerged in 2016 following an ocean circulation shift that enhanced the northeastward penetration of warm and saline waters from the western subtropics. The long ocean memory of the Subpolar North Atlantic implies that this advection-driven warming is likely to persist in the near-future with possible implications for the Atlantic multidecadal variability and its global impacts. The subpolar North Atlantic Ocean warmed sharply after 2016 as the transport of warm saline waters from the western subtropics was enhanced - following a period of cooling between 2006 and 2016 - according to analyses of observations via idealized modelling and machine-learning techniques.

One of the most severe environmental threats is excessive nutrient pollution from land, which causes oxygen depletion and harmful algal blooms. In 2018, the semi-enclosed Baltic Sea was determined to contain the largest hypoxic area among the world's coastal seas, with a size equal to the Republic of Ireland. In this study, ensemble modelling was used to investigate whether climate change will intensify hypoxia in the Baltic Sea and whether nutrient load abatement strategies would counteract this scenario. We analysed the largest ensemble of scenario simulations for the Baltic Sea currently available (including different boundary conditions) and estimated the magnitude of various sources of uncertainty. The results showed that natural variability was a larger source of uncertainty than previously considered. The earliest time and appropriate location to detect a trend above the background noise were estimated. A significant decrease in hypoxia can be achieved by further reductions in nutrient loads implemented in combination with existing measures. Natural variability makes future projections of hypoxia in the Baltic Sea uncertain, but nutrient load reductions can reduce its severity, shows a large range of future scenarios downscaled from an ensemble of Earth System models.

The unexpected radiative impact of the Hunga Tonga eruption of 15th January 2022	COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							STRATOSPHERIC AEROSOL LAYER; 2019 RAIKOKE; DISPERSION; SATELLITE; PLUMES	The underwater Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha-apai volcano erupted in the early hours of 15th January 2022, and injected volcanic gases and aerosols to over 50 km altitude. Here we synthesise satellite, ground-based, in situ and radiosonde observations of the eruption to investigate the strength of the stratospheric aerosol and water vapour perturbations in the initial weeks after the eruption and we quantify the net radiative impact across the two species using offline radiative transfer modelling. We find that the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha-apai eruption produced the largest global perturbation of stratospheric aerosols since the Pinatubo eruption in 1991 and the largest perturbation of stratospheric water vapour observed in the satellite era. Immediately after the eruption, water vapour radiative cooling dominated the local stratospheric heating/cooling rates, while at the top-of-the-atmosphere and surface, volcanic aerosol cooling dominated the radiative forcing. However, after two weeks, due to dispersion/dilution, water vapour heating started to dominate the top-of-the-atmosphere radiative forcing, leading to a net warming of the climate system. Perturbations to the global climate system changed from net cooling to net heating during the first month after the 2022 Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha-apai eruption, according to radiative forcing estimates based on satellite, ground-based, in situ and radiosonde observations.

Reductions in the deposition of sulfur and selenium to agricultural soils pose risk of future nutrient deficiencies	COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							ATMOSPHERIC SELENIUM; ANTHROPOGENIC EMISSIONS; COAL COMBUSTION; TECHNICAL NOTE; RECENT TRENDS; CLIMATE; MODEL; AEROSOL; BIOFORTIFICATION; UNCERTAINTY	Transition to cleaner fuels and improved pollution control will reduce atmospheric inputs of selenium and sulfur to agricultural soils, which increases the risk of nutrient deficiencies, according to atmospheric chemistry model projections. Atmospheric deposition is a major source of the nutrients sulfur and selenium to agricultural soils. Air pollution control and cleaner energy production have reduced anthropogenic emissions of sulfur and selenium, which has led to lower atmospheric deposition fluxes of these elements. Here, we use a global aerosol-chemistry-climate model to map recent (2005-2009) sulfur and selenium deposition, and project future (2095-2099) changes under two socioeconomic scenarios. Across the Northern Hemisphere, we find substantially decreased deposition to agricultural soils, by 70 to 90% for sulfur and by 55 to 80% for selenium. Recent trends in sulfur and selenium concentrations in USA streams suggest that catchment mass balances of these elements are already changing due to the declining atmospheric supply. Sustainable fertilizer management strategies will need to be developed to offset the decrease in atmospheric nutrient supply and ensure future food security and nutrition, while avoiding consequences for downstream aquatic ecosystems.

The event featured unprecedented regional mean temperature anomalies (+4.5 degrees C) over the Antarctic Peninsula between 6 and 11 February 2020 and the highest local temperature of the continental Antarctic region. Taking flow analogs of the event from past (1950-1984) and recent (1985-2019) periods of the ERA5 reanalysis, here we quantify the role of recent climate change in the magnitude of this 6-day regional heatwave. Results show that 2020-like heatwaves over the Antarctic Peninsula are now at least similar to 0.4 degrees C warmer than in the past period, which represents a similar to 25% increase in magnitude. Given the observed atmospheric circulation conditions, the probability of experiencing 6-day regional mean anomalies above similar to 2 degrees C has increased ten times since 1950-1984. The aggravated severity of the event can be largely ascribed to long-term summer warming of the Antarctic Peninsula rather than recent atmospheric circulation trends.

Accounting for tropical cyclones more than doubles the global population exposed to low-probability coastal flooding	COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							EXTREME SEA LEVELS; STORM SURGES; HURRICANE RISK; WATER LEVELS; SCALE; MODEL; WIND; ADAPTATION; PROFILES; DATABASE	Storm surges that occur along low-lying, densely populated coastlines can leave devastating societal, economical, and ecological impacts. To protect coastal communities from flooding, return periods of storm tides, defined as the combination of the surge and tide, must be accurately evaluated. Here we present storm tide return periods using a novel integration of two modelling techniques. For surges induced by extratropical cyclones, we use a 38-year time series based on the ERA5 climate reanalysis. For surges induced by tropical cyclones, we use synthetic tropical cyclones from the STORM dataset representing 10,000 years under current climate conditions. Tropical and extratropical cyclone surge levels are probabilistically combined with tidal levels, and return periods are computed empirically. We estimate that 78 million people are exposed to a 1 in 1000-year flood caused by extratropical cyclones, which more than doubles to 192M people when taking tropical cyclones into account. Our results show that previous studies have underestimated the global exposure to low-probability coastal flooding by 31%. Just under 200 million people are exposed to 1 in 1000-year coastal flooding events, about 31% more than previously estimated, according to a combination of numerical simulations which account for low-probability but high-impact tropical cyclones	[Dullaart, Job C.

The Greenland Sea is often viewed as the northern terminus of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. It has also been proposed that the shutdown of open-ocean deep convection in the Labrador or Greenland Seas would substantially weaken the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. Here we analyze Robust Diagnostic Calculations conducted in a high-resolution global coupled climate model constrained by observed hydrographic climatology to provide a holistic picture of the long-term mean Atlantic Overturning Circulation at northern high latitudes. Our results suggest that the Arctic Ocean, not the Greenland Sea, is the northern terminus of the mean Atlantic Overturning Circulation; open-ocean deep convection, in either the Labrador or Greenland Seas, contributes minimally to the mean Atlantic Overturning Circulation, hence it would not necessarily be substantially weakened by a shutdown of open-ocean deep convection; horizontal circulation across sloping isopycnals contributes substantially (more than 40%) to the maximum mean northeastern subpolar Atlantic Overturning Circulation.
