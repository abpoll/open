Carbon Nanotube Interlayer Enhances Water Permeance and Antifouling Performance of Nanofiltration Membranes: Mechanisms and Experimental Evidence	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						interlayered thin-film nanocomposite (TFNi); polyamide membranes; nanofiltration; fouling; water transport path	REVERSE-OSMOSIS MEMBRANES; PHYSIOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; NANOCOMPOSITE MEMBRANES; POLYAMIDE MEMBRANES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SUPPORT; RO; TECHNOLOGY; CHEMISTRY; REJECTION	Interlayered thin-film nanocomposite (TFNi) membranes have been shown to achieve enhanced water permeance as a result of the gutter effect. Nevertheless, some studies report impaired separation performance after the inclusion of an interlayer. In this study, we resolve the competing mechanisms of water transport in the transverse direction vs that in the normal direction. To enable easy comparison, carbon nanotube (CNT)-incorporated TFNi membranes with an identical polyamide rejection layer but different interlayer thicknesses were investigated. While increasing the thickness of the CNT interlayer facilitates water transport in the transverse direction (therefore improving the gutter effect), it simultaneously increases its hydraulic resistance in the normal direction. An optimal water permeance of 13.0 +/- 0.7 L m(-2) h(-1) bar(-1), which was more than doubled over the control membrane of 6.1 +/- 0.7 L m(-2) h(-1) bar(-1), was realized at a moderate interlayer thickness, resulting from the trade-off between these two competing mechanisms. In this study, we demonstrate reduced membrane fouling and improved fouling reversibility for a TFNi membrane over its control without an interlayer, which can be attributed to its more uniform water flux distribution. The fundamental mechanisms revealed in this study lay a solid foundation for the future development of TFNi membranes toward enhanced separation properties and antifouling ability.

With global climate change, there is a concern that the frequency and geographical expansion of ABs in L&Rs could increase. China has experienced rapid economic growth and major land-use changes over the last several decades and therefore provides an excellent context for such an analysis. About 289,600 Landsat images were used to examine the spatiotemporal distribution of ABs in L&Rs (>1 km(2)) across China (1983-2017). Results showed significant changes in the temporal slope of the sum of normalized area (0.26), frequency (2.28), duration (6.14), and early outbreak (-3.48) of AB events in L&Rs across China. Specifically, AB-impacted water bodies expanded longitudinally, and the time range of AB observation has expanded starting in the 2000s. Spearman correlation and random forest regression analyses further indicated that, among climatic factors, wind speed and temperature contributed the most to AB expansion. Overall, anthropogenic forces have overridden the imprints of climatic factors on the temporal evolution of ABs in China's L&Rs and therefore could inform policy decisions for the management of these resources.

However, an overall CCUS pipeline network blueprint remains poorly understood. This study, for the first time, links the China TIMES model and ChinaCCUS Decision Support System 2.0 to assess representative CCUS layouts for the power sector toward carbon neutrality, with the level of deployment and the maximum transportation distance from emission sources to storage sites considered. The total length of the proposed layouts under the low, medium, and high levels of deployment are about 5100, 18,000, and 37,000 km, with the annum CO2 captures of 0.4, 1.1, and 1.7 Gt, respectively, whereas pipes of medium diameters (12, 16, and 20 in) account for the majority in all three plans. As the deployment rate increases, the layouts generally spread from Northeast, North, and Northwest China to East, South Central, and Southwest China. However, some local exceptions take place considering terrain areas that the pipeline passes through. In addition to engineering guidance, this assessment also illuminates the opportunity for improving the efficiency of CCUS based on carbon pricing.

In this study, we developed tailored text mining methods and analyzed 29 188 papers published in ES&T from 2000 to 2019, and we performed data-driven analyses to reveal some critical information and guidance on what has been published, what topical changes have evolved, and what are the areas that deserve additional attention. While top research keywords remained stable (water, sorption, soil, emiss, oxid, exposur), the trending up and emerging keywords showed clear shift over the years. Keywords related to nanobased materials (nanoparticl, nanomateri, carbon nanotub), climate and energy (climat, ch4, greenhouse gas emiss, mitig, energi), and health (exposur, health, ingest) demonstrated the strongest uptrend in the past 10 years, while plastics and PFAS were among clear emerging topics in the past 5 years. Cooccurrence analysis showed distinct associations between media (water, soil, air, sediment), chemicals (pcb, humic subst, particulate matt), processes (sorption, remov, degrad), and properties (kinet, mechan, speciat). Furthermore, a rule-based classification deciphered trends, distributions, and interconnections of articles based on either monodomains (air, soil, solid waste, water, and wastewater) or multidomains. It found water and wastewater cross-discipline articles tended to have higher citation values, while air domain tended to stand alone. Water and air monodomains consistently increased their shares in publications (together 56.3% in 2019), while shares of soil studies gradually declined. This study provides new data-driven methods on literature mining and offers unique insights on environmental research landscape and opportunities.

Restoration of the degraded land has traditionally been viewed as an inherently sustainable practice; however, restoration processes render consequential environmental impacts which could potentially exceed the benefit of restoration itself. In the present study, an integrated life cycle assessment analysis was conducted to evaluate life cycle primary, secondary, and tertiary impacts associated with the restoration of the contaminated agricultural land. The results demonstrated the importance of including spatially differentiated impacts associated with managing the land and growing crops. Comparing four risk management scenarios at a contaminated field in Southern China, it was found that the primary and secondary impacts followed the order of no action > chemical stabilization > phytoextraction > alternative planting. However, when tertiary impacts were taken into account, alternative planting rendered much higher footprint in comparison with phytoextraction and chemical stabilization, which provides evidence against an emerging notion held by some policy makers. Furthermore, assuming that the loss of the rice paddy field in Southern China is compensated by the deforested land in the Amazon rainforest, the total global environmental impact would far exceed that of no action, resulting in 687 ton CO2-e ha(-1) of climate change impact. Overall, the present study provides new research findings to support more holistic policy making and also sheds lights on the future development of various restoration technologies.

Major electrical grid failure or "blackout" events in the United States, those with a duration of at least 1 h and impacting 50,000 or more utility customers, increased by more than 60% over the most recent 5 year reporting period. When such blackout events coincide in time with heat wave conditions, population exposures to extreme heat both outside and within buildings can reach dangerously high levels as mechanical air conditioning systems become inoperable. Here, we combine the Weather Research and Forecasting regional climate model with an advanced building energy model to simulate building-interior temperatures in response to concurrent heat wave and blackout conditions for more than 2.8 million residents across Atlanta, Georgia; Detroit, Michigan; and Phoenix, Arizona. Study results find simulated compound heat wave and grid failure events of recent intensity and duration to expose between 68 and 100% of the urban population to an elevated risk of heat exhaustion and/or heat stroke.

We evaluated the stocks, fate, and biological and biogeochemical effects of plastics in coastal wetlands with plastic abundance data from 112 studies. The representative abundance of plastics that occurs in coastal wetland sediments and is ingested by marine animals reaches 156.7 and 98.3 items kg(-1), respectively, 200 times higher than that (0.43 items kg(-1)) in the water column. Plastics are more abundant in mangrove forests and tidal marshes than in tidal flats and seagrass meadows. The variation in plastic abundance is related to climatic and geographic zones, seasons, and population density or plastic waste management. The abundance of plastics ingested by pelagic and demersal fish increases with fish length and dry weight. The dominant characteristics of plastics ingested by marine animals are correlated with those found in coastal wetland sediments. Microplastics exert negative effects on biota abundance and mangrove survival but positive effects on sediment nutrients, leaf drop, and carbon emission. We highlight that plastic pollution is widespread in coastal wetlands and actions are urged to include microplastics in ecosystem health and degradation assessment.

Past emission inventories were associated with high uncertainty due to data limitations, and recent information has provided a unique updating opportunity. Moreover, understanding the drivers that cause temporal emission changes is of research value. Here, we update the global BC emission estimates using new data on the activities and emission factors (EFs). The new inventory covers 73 detailed sources at 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees spatial resolution and monthly temporal resolution from 1960 to 2017. The estimated annual emissions were 32% higher than the average of several previous inventories, which was primarily due to field-measured EFs for residential stoves and differentiated EFs for motor vehicles. In addition, the updated emissions show an inverse U-shaped temporal trend, which was mainly driven by the interaction between the positive effects of population growth, per capita energy consumption, and vehicle fleet and the negative effects of residential energy switching, stove upgrading, phasing out of beehive coke ovens, and reduced EFs for vehicles and industrial processes. Urbanization caused a significant increase in urban emissions accompanied by a more significant decline in rural emissions.

Quantifying Regional Methane Emissions in the New Mexico Permian Basin with a Comprehensive Aerial Survey	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						methane emissions; oil and gas; leakage; hyperspectral imaging; remote sensing; airborne survey	NATURAL-GAS	Limiting emissions of climate-warming methane from oil and gas (O&G) is a major opportunity for short-term climate benefits. We deploy a basin-wide airborne survey of O&G extraction and transportation activities in the New Mexico Permian Basin, spanning 35 923 km(2), 26 292 active wells, and over 15 000 km of natural gas pipelines using an independently validated hyperspectral methane point source detection and quantification system. The airborne survey repeatedly visited over 90% of the active wells in the survey region throughout October 2018 to January 2020, totaling approximately 98 000 well site visits. We estimate total O&G methane emissions in this area at 194 (+72/-68, 95% CI) metric tonnes per hour (t/h), or 9.4% (+3.5%/-3.3%) of gross gas production. 50% of observed emissions come from large emission sources with persistence-averaged emission rates over 308 kg/h. The fact that a large sample size is required to characterize the heavy tail of the distribution emphasizes the importance of capturing low-probability, high-consequence events through basin-wide surveys when estimating regional O&G methane emissions.

Achieving this is expected to require removal of CO2 from the atmosphere to offset some hard-to-eliminate emissions. There is, therefore, a clear need for GHG accounting protocols that quantify the mitigation impact of CO2 removal practices, such as biochar sequestration, that have the potential to be deployed at scale. Here, we have developed a GHG accounting methodology for biochar application to mineral soils using simple parameterizations and readily accessible activity data that can be applied at a range of scales including farm, supply chain, national, or global. The method is grounded in a comprehensive analysis of current empirical data, making it a robust method that can be used for many applications including national inventories and voluntary and compliance carbon markets, among others. We show that the carbon content of biochar varies with feedstock and production conditions from as low as 7% (gasification of biosolids) to 79% (pyrolysis of wood at above 600 degrees C). Of this initial carbon, 63-82% will remain unmineralized in soil after 100 years at the global mean annual cropland-temperature of 14.9 degrees C. With this method, researchers and managers can address the long-term sequestration of C through biochar that is blended with soils through assessments such as GHG inventories and life cycle analyses.

Here, we determined, by laboratory and on-board measurements of ship engine exhaust, fuel-specific particle number (PN) emissions for different fuels and desulfurization applied in shipping. The emission factors were compared to ship exhaust plume observations and, furthermore, exploited in the assessment of global PN emissions from shipping, utilizing the STEAM ship emission model. The results indicate that most particles in the fresh ship engine exhaust are in ultrafine particle size range. Shipping PN emissions are localized, especially close to coastal lines, but significant emissions also exist on open seas and oceans. The global annual PN produced by marine shipping was 1.2 x 10(28) (+/- 0.34 x 10(28)) particles in 2016, thus being of the same magnitude with total anthropogenic PN emissions in continental areas. The reduction potential of PN from shipping strongly depends on the adopted technology mix, and except wide adoption of natural gas or scrubbers, no significant decrease in global PN is expected if heavy fuel oil is mainly replaced by low sulfur residual fuels. The results imply that shipping remains as a significant source of anthropogenic PN emissions that should be considered in future climate and health impact models.

Methane and NOx Emissions from Natural Gas Stoves, Cooktops, and Ovens in Residential Homes	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						cooking; climate; combustion; pollutants; post-meter emissions; appliances; houses	COOKING BURNERS; EXHAUST; PERFORMANCE	Natural gas stoves in >40 million U.S. residences release methane (CH4)-a potent greenhouse gas-through post-meter leaks and incomplete combustion. We quantified methane released in 53 homes during all phases of stove use: steady-state-off (appliance not in use), steady-state-on (during combustion), and transitory periods of ignition and extinguishment. We estimated that natural gas stoves emit 0.8-1.3% of the gas they use as unburned methane and that total U.S. stove emissions are 28.1 [95% confidence interval: 18.5, 41.2] Gg CH4 year(-1). More than three-quarters of methane emissions we measured originated during steady-state-off. Using a 20-year timeframe for methane, annual methane emissions from all gas stoves in U.S. homes have a climate impact comparable to the annual carbon dioxide emissions of 500 000 cars. In addition to methane emissions, co-emitted health-damaging air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) are released into home air and can trigger respiratory diseases. In 32 homes, we measured NOx (NO and NO2) emissions and found them to be linearly related to the amount of natural gas burned (r(2) = 0.76; p << 0.01). Emissions averaged 21.7 [20.5, 22.9] ng NOx J(-1), comprised of 7.8 [7.1, 8.4] ng NO2 J(-1) and 14.0 [12.8, 15.1] ng NO J(-1). Our data suggest that families who don't use their range hoods or who have poor ventilation can surpass the 1-h national standard of NO2 (100 ppb) within a few minutes of stove usage, particularly in smaller kitchens.

The direct climatic effect of such SOA cannot be quantified because its optical properties and atmospheric fate are poorly understood. In this study, we generated SOA from the NO3 center dot oxidation of a series BVOCs including isoprene, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes. The SOA were subjected to comprehensive online and offline chemical composition analysis using high-resolution mass spectrometry and optical properties measurements using a novel broadband (315-650 nm) cavityenhanced spectrometer, which covers the wavelength range needed to understand the potential contribution of the SOA to direct radiative forcing. The SOA contained a significant fraction of oxygenated organic nitrates (ONs), consisting of monomers and oligomers that are responsible for the detected light absorption in the 315-400 nm range. The SOA created from beta-pinene and alpha-humulene was further photochemically aged in an oxidation flow reactor. The SOA has an atmospheric photochemical bleaching lifetime of >6.2 h, indicating that some of the ONs in the SOA may serve as atmosphere-stable nitrogen oxide sinks or reservoirs and will absorb and scatter incoming solar radiation during the daytime.

In recent decades, atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition has increased dramatically as an important agricultural soil N input, while its effect on soil N2O emissions in the current and future climate change remains unknown. Here, we conducted a thorough analysis of the effect of N deposition and climate change on soil N2O emissions as well as their trends. Soil N2O emissions induced by N deposition accounted for 25% of global cropland soil N2O emissions. Global soil N2O emissions over croplands increased by 2% yr(-1) during 1996-2013, of which N deposition could explain 15% of the increase. The emission factor of N deposition was similar to 7 times that of N fertilizer plus manure (similar to 1%) through a more direct way, since N deposition including nitrate (NO3-) and ammonium (NH4+) could be directly used for nitrification and denitrification. By 2100, N deposition will increase by 80% and cropland soil N2O emissions will increase by 241% under the RCP8.5 scenario in comparison with the 2010 baseline. These results suggest that, under the background of increasing global N deposition, it is essential to consider its effects on soil N2O emissions in climatic change studies.

In this study, we implemented a large spatial-scale and multiseason and -layer seawater sampling campaign in high BC emission influenced coastal China seas (Bohai Sea and Northern Yellow Sea) and quantified the thermal/optical reflectance-based particulate BC (PBC) and benzene polycarboxylic acids-based dissolved BC (DBC). We found that the climate and its associated hydrological effects (including the intensive resuspension and coastal current transport) largely regulate both PBC and DBC spatiotemporal variations and dynamics. In combination with previous work on upstream rivers and downstream open ocean, a significant and continuous decrease in the DBC aromatic condensation was observed along the river-to-ocean continuum, probably due to the increment of the photochemical degradation during the waterborne transport. Based on our DBC methodological development, i.e., the determination and subsequent inclusion of the nitrated BC molecular markers, the magnitudes of the current global DBC fluxes and pools were updated. After the update, the DBC fluxes from atmospheric deposition and riverine delivery were estimated at rates of 4.3 and 66.3 Tg yr(-1), respectively, and the global oceanic DBC pool was approximately 36 Gt. This update will greatly assist in constructing a more robust regional and global DBC and BC cycling and budgets.

However, global patterns and controlling factors of soil DNRA are still only rudimentarily known. By a meta-analysis of 231 observations from 85 published studies across terrestrial ecosystems, we find a global mean DNRA rate of 0.31 +/- 0.05 mg N kg(-1) day(-1), being significantly greater in paddy soils (1.30 +/- 0.59) than in forests (0.24 +/- 0.03), grasslands (0.52 +/- 0.15), and unfertilized croplands (0.18 +/- 0.04). Soil DNRA was significantly enhanced at higher altitude and lower latitude. Soil DNRA was positively correlated with precipitation, temperature, pH, soil total carbon, and soil total N. Precipitation was the main stimulator for soil DNRA. Total carbon and pH were also important factors, but their effects were ecosystem-specific as total carbon stimulates DNRA in forest soils, whereas pH stimulates DNRA in unfertilized croplands and paddy soils. Higher temperatures inhibit soil DNRA via decreasing total carbon. Moreover, nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were negatively related to soil DNRA. Thus, future changes in climate and land-use may interact with management practices that alter soil substrate availability and/or soil pH to enhance soil DNRA with positive effects on N conservation and lower N2O emissions.

The present study aims to project future soil erosion and sediment deposition in the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB) using climate projections by five Global Circulation Models (GCMs) under the Representative Concentrations Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario. To understand the importance of freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) for soil erosion and sediment deposition estimation with climate change, this study compared two Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) models with different representations of the FTCs, with the standard SWAT using a simple regression method and SWAT-FT employing a physically based method. Modeling results show that future climate change can pronouncedly intensify soil erosion and increase sediment deposition, and the impacts are sensitive to how FTCs are represented in the model. The standard SWAT projected an increase in soil erosion by nearly 40% by the end of the 21st century, which is much lower than the projected over 65% increase in soil erosion by SWAT-FT. For sediment deposition, the projected percent changes by the standard SWAT and SWAT-FT also deviate from each other (i.e., about 70% by the standard SWAT vs about 120% by SWAT-FT). Overall, these results demonstrate the important roles of FTCs in projecting future soil erosion and sediment deposition and underline the need to consider the effects of conservation practices on FTCs to realistically assess the effectiveness of those measures.

To achieve this, the present study advocates megacities to implement a two-tier synergic governance system consisting of both synergic governance between GHG and air pollutant emission reductions and between megacities and their surrounding regions. Based on the LEAP model and WRFSMOKE-CMAQ simulation platform, this study found that climate governance of China's megacity, Shenzhen, could synergistically contribute to decreasing urban annual PM2.5 concentration by 5.6% in 2030. Using synergic governance with surrounding regions could further help cap and then quickly decrease the megacity's GHG emissions and lower its PM2.5 concentrations by an additional 11.8%. The results demonstrated the substantial effects of transdepartment and transregional synergic governance on Shenzhen's GHG emission reduction and air quality improvement. Furthermore, this study suggested road transportation and power generation and supply as the two priority fields for wide-ranging megacities to promote two-tier synergic governance, highlighting an integration of improved urban electrification with high-efficiency electricity use and a renewable-based power supply.

Fossil fuelburning for transportation energy accounts for a significant fraction of urban air and climate pollution.While current United States (US) standards limit PM ambient concentrations and emissions, they donot regulate explicitly ultrafine particles (UFP <= 100 nm in diameter). There is a growing body ofevidence suggesting UFP may play a bigger role inflicting adverse health impacts than has beenrecognized, and in this perspective, we highlight effects on the brain, particularly of young individuals.UFP penetrate the body through nasal/olfactory, respiratory, gastrointestinal, placenta, and brain-blood barriers, translocating in the bloodstream and reaching the glymphatic and central nervoussystems. We discuss one case study. The 21.8 million residents in the Metropolitan Mexico City(MMC) are regularly exposed tofine PM (PM2.5) above the US 12 mu g/m3annual average standards.Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP-43)pathologies and nanoparticles (NP <= 50 nm in diameter) in critical brain organelles have beendocumented in MMC children and young adult autopsies. MMC young residents have cognitive andolfaction deficits, altered gait and equilibrium, brainstem auditory evoked potentials, and sleepdisorders. Higher risk of AD and vascular dementia associated with residency close to high traffic roadways have been documented.The US is not ready or prepared to adopt ambient air quality or emission standards for UFP and will continue to focus regulationsonly on the total mass of PM2.5and PM10. Thus, this approach raises the question:are we dropping the ball?As research continues toanswer the remaining questions about UFP sources, exposures, impacts, and controls, the precautionary principle should call us toaccelerate and expand policy interventions to abate or eliminate UFP emissions and to mitigate UFP exposures. For residents ofhighly polluted cities, particularly in the developing world where there is likely older and dirtier vehicles, equipment, and fuels in useand less regulatory oversight, we should embark in a strong campaign to raise public awareness of the associations between high PMpollution, heavy traffic, UFP, NP, and neuropsychiatric outcomes, including dementia.

We combine three complementary satellite data sets to survey single methane emission sources on the west coast of Turkmenistan, one of the largest methane hotspots in the world. We found 29 different emitters, with emission rates >1800 kg/h, active in the 2017-2020 time period, although older satellite data show that this type of emission has been occurring for decades. We find that all sources are linked to extraction fields mainly dedicated to crude oil production, where 24 of them are inactive flares venting gas. The analysis of time series suggests a causal relationship between the decrease in flaring and the increase in venting. At the regional level, 2020 shows a substantial increase in the number of methane plume detections concerning previous years. Our results suggest that these large venting point sources represent a key mitigation opportunity as they emanate from human-controlled facilities, and that new satellite methods promise a revolution in the detection and monitoring of methane point emissions worldwide.

Deep CCS: Moving Beyond 90% Carbon Dioxide Capture	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						deep decarbonization; capture rate; carbon dioxide removal	POSTCOMBUSTION CO2 CAPTURE; FIRED POWER-PLANTS; NATURAL-GAS; ENERGY SYSTEM; FLUE-GAS; ELECTRICITY PRODUCTION; NEGATIVE EMISSIONS; METHANE EMISSIONS; STORAGE; ADSORPTION	The large-scale deployment of carbon capture technologies is expected to play a crucial role in efforts to meet stringent climate targets set forth by the Paris Agreement, but current models rely heavily upon carbon dioxide removal (CDR) strategies for which viability at the gigatonne scale is uncertain. While most 1.5 and 2 degrees C scenarios project rapid decarbonization of the energy sector facilitated by carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), they generally assume that CCS units can only capture similar to 90% of the CO2 in coal and natural gas combustion flues because this was previously considered the optimal condition for aqueous amine scrubbers. In this Perspective, we discuss a small but growing body of literature that examines the prospect of moving significantly beyond 90% capture-a concept we term deep CCS. in light of recent developments in materials and process design. The low incremental costs associated with performing varying degrees of deep CCS suggest that this approach is not only feasible but may also alleviate burdens placed upon CDR techniques facing significant barriers to large-scale deployment. We estimate that rapid deployment of deep CCS in deep decarbonization pathways could avoid more than 1 gigatonne of CO2 globally each year. The principles of deep CCS could also be applied directly to the CDR strategy of employing bioenergy with CCS, which could lead to a significant alleviation of the land and freshwater burden associated with this technology.

Compared to conventional hydrothermal catalysis, electrocatalysis possesses the advantage of mild operational conditions and high selectivity, yet the potential energy savings and climate change mitigation have rarely been assessed. This study conducted a life cycle assessment (LCA) for the electrocatalytic oxidation of crude glycerol to produce lactic acid, one of the most common platform chemicals. The LCA results demonstrated a 31% reduction in global warming potential (GWP) compared to the benchmark (bio- and chemocatalytic) processes. Additionally, electrocatalysis yielded a synergetic potential to mitigate climate change depending on the scenario. For example, electrocatalysis combined with a low-carbon-intensity grid can reduce GWP by 57% if the process yields lactic acid and lignocellulosic biofuel as compared to a conventional fossil-based system with functionally equivalent products. This illustrates the potential of electrocatalysis as an important contributor to climate change mitigation across multiple industries. A technoeconomic analysis (TEA) for electrocatalytic lactic acid production indicated considerable challenges in economic feasibility due to the significant upfront capital cost. This challenge could be largely addressed by enabling dual redox processing to produce separate streams of renewable chemicals and biofuels simultaneously.

The six analyzed surface and underground coal mines are estimated to emit 570 +/- 98 Gg a(-1) in 2018-2019. Together, they account for 7% of the national coal production while emitting 55 +/- 10% of the reported methane emission from coal mining in Australia. Our results indicate that for two of the three locations, our satellite-based estimates are significantly higher than reported to the Australian government. Most remarkably, 40% of the quantified emission came from a single surface mine (Hail Creek) located in a methane-rich coal basin. Our findings call for increased monitoring and investment in methane recovery technologies for both surface and underground mines.

Soil physicochemical properties locally govern the variation of the total copper content (Cu-t) in EU vineyards. However, variables controlling Cu-t distribution at a larger scale are poorly known. Here, machine learning techniques were used to identify governing variables and to predict the Cu-t distribution in EU vineyards. Precipitation, aridity and soil organic carbon are key variables explaining together 45% of Cu-t distribution across EU vineyards. This underlines the effect of both climate and soil properties on Cu-t distribution. The average net export of Cu at the EU scale is 0.29 kg Cu ha(-1), which is 2 orders of magnitude less than the net accumulation of Cu (24.8 kg Cu ha(-1)). Four scenarios of Cuf application were compared. The current EU regulation with a maximum of 4 kg Cu ha(-1) year(-1) may increase by 2% of the EU vineyard area, exceeding the predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) in soil in the next 100 years. Overall, our results highlight the vineyard areas requiring specific remediation measures and strategies of Cu-f use to manage a trade-off between pest control and soil and water contamination.

In this study, we compare the well-to-wheels (WTW) greenhouse gas (GHG) emission intensities of PEVs with those of gasoline vehicles at the provincial level in the year 2017 by considering the heterogeneity in the consumption-based electricity mix and climate impacts on vehicle fuel economy. Results show a high variation of provincial WTW GHG emission intensities for battery electric vehicles (BEVs, 22-293 g CO(2)eq/km) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs, 82-298 g CO(2)eq/km) in contrast to gasoline internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs, 227-245 g CO(2)eq/km) and gasoline hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs, 141-164 g CO(2)eq/km). Due to the GHG-intensive coal-based electricity and cold weather, WTW GHG emission intensities of BEVs and PHEVs are higher than those of gasoline ICEVs in seven and ten northern provinces in China, respectively. WTW GHG emission intensities of gasoline HEVs, on the other hand, are lower in 18 and 26 provinces than those of BEVs and PHEVs, respectively. The analysis suggests that province-specific PEV and electric grid development policies should be considered for GHG emission reductions of on-road transportation in China.

The scale of this study offers new insight into both average penetration rates and drivers of heterogeneity in the outdoor-indoor relationship. We find that an increase in the daily outdoor PM concentration of 10% leads to an average increase of 4.2-6.1% in indoor concentrations. The penetration of outdoor particles to the indoor environment occurs rapidly and almost entirely within 5 h. We also provide evidence showing that penetration rates are associated with building age and climatic conditions in the vicinity of the monitor. Since people spend a substantial amount of each day indoors, our findings fill a critical knowledge gap and have significant implications for government policies to improve public health through reductions in exposure to ambient air pollution.

On the demand side, climate change could shift demand patterns due to increased air temperatures. On the supply side, climate change could lead to deratings of thermal units due to changes in air temperature, water temperature, and water availability. Past studies have typically analyzed these risks separately. Her; we developed an integrated, multimodel framework to analyze how compounding risks of climate-change impacts on demand and supply affect long-term planning decisions in the power system. In the southeast U.S., we found that compounding climate-change impacts could result in a 35% increase in installed capacity by 2050 relative to the reference case. Participation of renewables, particularly solar, in the fleet increased, driven mostly by the expected increase in summertime peak demand. Such capacity requirements would increase investment costs by approximately 31 billion (USD 2015) over the next 30 years, compared to the reference case. These changes in investment decisions align with carbon emission mitigation strategies, highlighting how adaptation and mitigation strategies can converge.

In this study, we continuously measured VOCs in astainless-steel environmentally controlled climate chamber (22.5 m3, air changerate at 3.2 h-1) occupied by four seated human volunteers using proton transferreaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry and gas chromatography massspectrometry. Experiments with human whole body, breath-only, and dermal-only emissions were performed under ozone-free and ozone-present conditions. Inaddition, the effect of temperature, relative humidity, clothing type, and age wasinvestigated for whole-body emissions. Without ozone, the whole-body totalemission rate (ER) was 2180 +/- 620 mu gh-1per person (p-1), dominated byexhaled chemicals. The ERs of oxygenated VOCs were positively correlated with the enthalpy of the air. Under ozone-presentconditions (similar to 37 ppb), the whole-body total ER doubled, with the increase mainly driven by VOCs resulting from skin surfacelipids/ozone reactions, which increased with relative humidity. Long clothing (more covered skin) was found to reduce the total ERsbut enhanced certain chemicals related to the clothing. The ERs of VOCs derived from this study provide a valuable data set ofhuman emissions under various conditions and can be used in models to better predict indoor air quality, especially for highlyoccupied environments.

While early studies have evaluated their impact globally or regionally, the BVOC emissions emitted from urban green spaces (denoted as U-BVOC emissions) have been largely ignored primarily due to the failure of low-resolution land cover in resolving such processes, but also because their important contribution to urban BVOCs was previously unrecognized. In this study, by utilizing a recently released high-resolution land cover dataset, we develop the first set of emission inventories of U-BVOCs in China at spatial resolutions as high as 1 km. This new dataset resolved densely distributed U-BVOCs in urban core areas. The U-BVOC emissions in megacities could account for a large fraction of total BVOC emissions, and the good agreement of the interannual variations between the U-BVOC emissions and ozone concentrations over certain regions stresses their potentially crucial role in influencing ozone variations. The newly constructed U-BVOC emission inventory is expected to provide an improved dataset to enable the research community to re-examine the modulation of BVOCs on the formation of ozone, SOA, and atmospheric chemistry in urban environments.

Here, we investigate the decomposition process and microbiome of one of the most promising biobased and biodegradable plastics, poly(butylene succinate-co-adipate) (PBSA), under field soil conditions under both ambient and future predicted climates (for the time between 2070 and 2100). We show that the gravimetric and molar mass of PBSA is already largely reduced (28-33%) after 328 days under both climates. We provide novel information on the PBSA microbiome encompassing the three domains of life: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya (fungi). We show that PBSA begins to decompose after the increase in relative abundances of aquatic fungi (Tetracladium spp.) and nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The PBSA microbiome is distinct from that of surrounding soils, suggesting that PBSA serves as a new ecological habitat. We conclude that the microbial decomposition process of PBSA in soil is more complex than previously thought by involving interkingdom relationships, especially between bacteria and fungi.
