J	Huang, MT; Zhai, PM				Huang Meng-Tian; Zhai Pan-Mao			Achieving Paris Agreement temperature goals requires carbon neutrality by middle century with far-reaching transitions in the whole society	ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH			English	Article						Carbon neutrality; Carbon emissions peak; Climate change; Paris agreement; Green recovery; COVID-19 pandemic		The concept of carbon neutrality is much emphasized in IPCC Spatial Report on Global Warming of 1.5 degrees C in order to achieve the long-term temperature goals as reflected in Paris Agreement. To keep these goals within reach, peaking the global carbon emissions as soon as possible and achieving carbon neutrality are urgently needed. However, global CO2 emissions continued to grow up to a record high of 43.1 Gt CO2 during 2019, with fossil CO2 emissions of 36.5 Gt CO2 and land-use change emissions of 6.6 Gt CO2. In such case, the global carbon emissions must drop 32 Gt CO2 (7.6% per year) from 2020 to 2030 for the 1.5 degrees C warming limit, which is even larger than the COVID-induced reduction (6.4%) in global CO2 emissions during 2020. Recently, China has announced scaling up its national commitments, aiming to peak its CO2 emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. Achieving these goals requires rapid and far-reaching transitions in the whole society. On the one hand, deeper emissions reduction in all sectors includes decarbonization of energy, electrification, increasing share of renewables, energy efficiency, sustainable land management, decarbonization of transport, reducing food loss and waste, as well as behavior and lifestyles changes. On the other hand, possible actions by removing CO2 from the atmosphere involves enlarging land and ocean net carbon sink, CO2 removal technologies (such as Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage), and CO2 capture, utilization and storage technologies, but should be caution for their scales and tradeoffs.

Permafrost degradation significantly affects forest and vegetation ecosystems, as well as the safety of engineering projects and other man-made infrastructures. However, the permafrost change in the region is still unclear. This study uses metrological data from 258 weather stations, alongside reanalysis data, and other environmental data to investigate permafrost degradation and its related environmental impacts in Northeast China from the 1950s to 2010s. Results show that the total permafrost area decreased from 4.8 x 10(5) to 3.1 x 10(5) km(2) from the 1950s to the 2010s. The southern limit of permafrost moved 0.1-1.1 degrees northward, and its average elevation rose 160.5 m. During the study period, the degradation of predominantly continuous permafrost, and discontinuous and island permafrost was more pronounced than that of sparsely island permafrost. The south boundary of those three permafrost zones northward by 0-3.4 degrees, 0-5.5 degrees and 0.4-1.1 degrees, the average altitude raised by 339.2 m, 208.3 m, 67.1 m. The permafrost degradation shows the elevation and latitude zonality. Permafrost degradation is mainly caused by the rising of surface temperatures and the impacts of other environmental factors. The snowfall warming the ground of 1.1-10.2 degrees C in cold seasons and rainfall cooling on surface conditions in warm seasons, those may result in temporal and spatial differences in permafrost degradation. However, there are lack of researches in the impact of environment factors on soil temperatures, moisture and permafrost degradation.

However, such coordination remains understudied, especially at the local level. Using the principal component analysis, entropy evaluation methods, and the Coupling Coordination Degree Model (CCDM), we evaluated the level of coordination between carbon and air quality mitigation from 34 low-carbon pilot cities in China. We also illustrated the mechanism and policy formation that leads to different coupling patterns at the local level using three case studies. We found that most pilot cities perform a medium level of coupling coordination between low carbon development and air quality. The result reveals that most low-carbon pilot cities score relatively well in low-carbon development. Further, there is a significant cleavage in air quality between cities in the North and those in the South, indicating pilot cities in the South coordinate better than those in the North. In particular, pilot programs in the Southwest and Southeast coastal region perform well in collaborative governance, while the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region is rated poorly because of the gap between air quality and low carbon development. Also, we found that the same low-carbon policy might have heterogeneous effects on different air pollutants and across different regions. The local government should adopt low-carbon development policies that address local level specific environmental and economic conditions to maximize their air pollution mitigation benefits.

J	Song, X; Wang, DY; Li, F; Zeng, XD				Song Xiang; Wang Dan-Yun; Li Fang; Zeng Xiao-Dong			Evaluating the performance of CMIP6 Earth system models in simulating global vegetation structure and distribution	ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH			English	Article						Earth system model; CMIP6; Leaf area index; Vegetation distribution; Tree height	TERRESTRIAL CARBON-CYCLE; LEAF-AREA; CLIMATE; SCHEME; PATTERNS; IMPACT; ENERGY; PHASE	Evaluation of vegetation structure and distribution simulations in Earth system models (ESMs) is the basis for understanding historical reconstruction and future projection of changes in terrestrial ecosystems, carbon cycle, and climate based on these ESMs. Such assessments can also provide important information of models' merits and shortcomings or systematic biases, and so clues for model development. Vegetation structure and distribution in ESMs are primarily characterized by three variables: leaf area index (LAI), tree height, and fractional coverage of plant functional type (PFT). However, for the ongoing Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), only temporal variabilities of global-averaged LAI time series were evaluated, others remain largely uninvestigated. This study systematically investigates the spatial and/or temporal variability of the three critical variables from 27 ESMs in CMIP6 using satellite observations. Our results show that all models and the multi-model ensemble mean (MME) can generally reproduce the observed LAI spatial pattern but all of them overestimate the global mean LAI mainly due to overestimation of LAI in non-forested vegetated areas. Most CMIP6 models fail to capture the temporal variability in the annual LAI because of large biases in both the simulated trend magnitude and temporal pattern of interannual variability. The average LAI seasonal cycles in different latitude zones are roughly reproduced by the models, but 1-2 months delays in the LAI peak appear in the Arctic-boreal zone. Additionally, CMIP6 models overall overestimate tree height, and largely overestimate the global grass area but underestimate tree and shrub areas, especially in the middle and high latitudes. It should be kept in mind that such biases may have further impacts on the simulations of the related carbon and land-atmosphere interaction variables (e.g., ecosystem production, carbon storage, transpiration, and temperature) for global change research. Hence, bias-correction should be made to improve reliability of vegetation structure and distribution when future projections and historical reconstructions. They also underscore the urgent need in development and parameterization of dynamic vegetation within Earth system models, such as phenology, allocation, and morphology schemes.

The response of permafrost to climate change remains unclear due to limited field investigations. Thus, longer-term responses of the ground thermal state to climate change since 2011 have been monitored at four sites with varied surface characteristics: Carex tato wetland (P1) and shrub-C. tato wetland (P2) with a multi-year average temperatures at the depth of zero annual amplitude (T-ZAA) of -0.52 and -1.19 degrees C, respectively; Betula platyphylla-Larix gmelinii (Rupr.) Kuzen mixed forest (P3) with T-ZAA of 0.17 degrees C, and; the forest of L. gmelinii (Rupr.) Kuzen (P4) with T-ZAA of 1.65 degrees C. Continuous observations demonstrate that the ecosystem-protected Xing'an permafrost experienced a cooling under a warming climate. The temperature at the top of permafrost (TTOP) rose (1.8 degrees C per decade) but the T-ZAA declined (-0.14 degrees C per decade), while the active layer thickness (ALT) thinned from 0.9 m in 2012 to 0.8 m in 2014 at P1. Both the TTOP and T-ZAA increased (0.89 and 0.06 degrees C per decade, respectively), but the ALT thinned from 1.4 m in 2012 to 0.7 m in 2016 at P2. Vertically detached permafrost at P3 disappeared in summer 2012, with warming rates of +0.42 and + 0.17 degrees C per decade for TTOP and T-ZAA, respectively. However, up to date, the ground thermal state has remained stable at P4. We conclude that the thermal offset is crucial for the preservation and persistence of the Xing'an permafrost at the southern fringe.

This study investigated changes in drought conditions and their impacts on vegetation growth over the Tibetan Plateau. The results reveal that the precipitation in growing season (May-September) shows a significant increase over most parts of the central and eastern Tibetan Plateau during 1961-2019. Consequently, drought conditions have generally relieved except in the south and northeast where precipitation has decreased. Combining analyses of gridded-dataset-derived drought indices with vegetation indices during 1982-2015, vegetation improvement in most regions of the Plateau is mainly due to lessened drought conditions. Noticeably, vegetation degradation is also found in part of southern Tibetan Plateau mainly resulting from drought enhancement. This study is expected to provide scientific basis for understanding of change in drought condition and its impacts on vegetation over different regions of TP under global warming background.

J	Fu, YH; Gao, XJ; Zhu, YM; Guo, D				Fu Yuan-Hai; Gao Xue-Jie; Zhu Ying-Mo; Guo Dong			Climate change projection over the Tibetan Plateau based on a set of RCM simulations	ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH			English	Article						Climate change; Regional climate model; Tibetan plateau	EARTH-SYSTEM; MODEL; PRECIPITATION; CHINA; REGCM4; TEMPERATURE; EXTREMES; DATASET; CMIP5	Tibetan Plateau (TP, with the height > 3000 m) is a region with complex topographical features and a large diversity of climate both in space and time. The use of higher resolution regional climate models (RCMs) to downscale global climate model simulations is of high importance. In the present study, future climate change over TP and the surrounding areas is investigated based on the ensemble of a set of the 21st century climate change projections using the RCM RegCM4. The model is driven by five different GCMs at a grid spacing of 25 km under RCP4.5. The focus is on the December-January-February (DJF), June-July-August (JJA), and annual mean temperature and precipitation, with comparisons against the driving GCMs also provided. Overall, the RegCM4 greatly improves the simulation by providing finer scale spatial details of both temperature and precipitation distributions over the region. The topographic effects are well reproduced by RegCM4 but not the GCMs. For the projected future changes, general warming and increase in precipitation are found in both GCM and RegCM4 simulations. However, substantial differences exist in both the spatial distribution and magnitude of the changes. The added value of RegCM4 for temperature, in addition to the finer spatial details, is characterized by a more pronounced warming in DJF over TP compared to its surrounding areas. The projected changes of precipitation show also differences between RegCM4 and the driving GCMs. The increase of precipitation is more pronounced and over the basins in DJF for RegCM4, and in general with a better agreement across the simulations compared to the driving GCMs.	[Fu Yuan-Hai; Gao Xue-Jie; Guo Dong] Chinese Acad Sci, Climate Change Res Ctr, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Gao Xue-Jie] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Gao Xue-Jie] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Zhu Ying-Mo] Yunnan Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Kunming 650504, Yunnan, Peoples R China	Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Yunnan University	Gao, XJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Climate Change Res Ctr, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.	gaoxuejie@mail.iap.ac.cn	Gao, Xuejie/B-8360-2013	Gao, Xuejie/0000-0002-2162-4037	Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA2006040102]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program (STEP) [2019QZKK1001]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41675103]; Science and Technology Programof Yunnan [2018BC007]	Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program (STEP); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science and Technology Programof Yunnan	This research was supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA2006040102), the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program (STEP) (2019QZKK1001), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41675103), and the Science and Technology Programof Yunnan (2018BC007).

Precipitation-related extremes has substantial socioeconomic impacts under the changing climate. Quantifying population exposure to precipitation extreme is the fundamental aspect of population risk assessments in the climate hotspot of Indus River Basin. This study investigates the population exposure to precipitation extremes at 1.5 degrees C, 2.0 degrees C, and 3.0 degrees C global warmings in the Indus River Basin using daily precipitation data, and projected population under shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). The Intensity-Area-Duration method was applied to detect the extreme precipitation event by tracing the rainstorm process, calculated based on five downscaled and bias-corrected Global Climate Model (GCM) outputs from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) under four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5). The exposure of the population is finally estimated by combing SSP1 with 1.5 degrees C, SSP2 with 2.0 degrees C, and SSP5 with 3.0 degrees C warming levels. Results show that warming over the Indus River Basin is projected to be higher than that of the global average. Both the extreme precipitation events and population exposure are projected to increase with warming level. With regard to the reference period (1986-2005), the frequency, duration, and impacted area of extreme precipitation are projected to increase by 13.2%, 7.4%, and 1.6% annually under 1.5 degrees C in the Indus River Basin, respectively. Whereas, an additional 0.5 degrees C and 1.5 degrees C warming can lead to further increase in the frequency of 16.6%, 17.3%, as well as the duration of 8.6%, 12%, and areal coverage of 2.1%, 5.3%, respectively. The population exposure to extreme precipitation is projected to increase by 72.4%, 122.7%, and 87.6%, respectively, at SSP1 with 1.5 degrees C, SSP2 with 2.0 degrees C and SSP5 with 3.0 degrees C warming levels compare to the reference period. The demographic change is responsible more for the tremendous increment of population exposure in the Indus River Basin. If the population was held constant to the level of 2010, the increase of population exposure would be 4.4%, 8.8%, and 17.6%, respectively, at 1.5 degrees C, 2.0 degrees C, and 3.0 degrees C warming levels. Spatially, the prominent increment of population exposure is projected in the central and southwestern Indus River Basin. This study highlights that limiting the increase of temperature to 1.5 degrees C can substantially reduce population exposure to extreme precipitation events in the Indus River Basin, compared to an additional warming. Simultaneously, urge paid to formulate policies on population growth to reduce future exposure.

However, current understanding of the influences of permafrost on hydrological dynamics is insufficient. This study investigated historical variations in permafrost conditions and their potential hydrologic effects over the Russian Arctic drainage basin. The results show that soil temperature (at 0.40 m below surface) has increased about 1.4 degrees C over the Ob, 1.5 degrees C over the Yenisei, and 1.8 degrees C over the Lena River basin from 1936 through 2013, possibly resulted in a significant thawing of permafrost. Rapid active layer changes have occurred since the 1970s. The volume of the active layer increased by 28, 142, and 228 km(3) over the Ob, Yenisei, and Lena basins, respectively, since the 1970s. Melting ground ice caused by deepening active layer may be a limited contribution to annual runoff. Runoff during freeze season (October-April) showed significant positive correlations (p < 0.05) to active layer thickness in the Yenisei and Lena basins while negative correlation (p > 0.05) in the Ob basin. These results imply that, in basins with high permafrost coverage, a deeper active layer increased soil water storage capacity and perhaps contribute to an increase in winter runoff.

J	Li, HM; Wang, XC; Zhao, XF; Qi, Y				Li Hui-Min; Wang Xue-Chun; Zhao Xiao-Fan; Qi Ye			Understanding systemic risk induced by climate change	ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH			English	Article						Systemic risk; Climate change; Disaster; Risk assessment	GLOBAL GOVERNANCE; MORTALITY; LESSONS; WARS	The systemic risk induced by climate change represents one of the most prominent threats facing humanity and has attracted increasing attention since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic at the end of 2019. The existing literature highlights the importance of systemic risk induced by climate change, but there are still deficiencies in understanding its dynamics and assessing the risk. Aiming to bridge this gap, this study develops a theoretical framework and employs two cases to illustrate the concept, origin, occurrence, propagation, evolution, and assessment framework of systemic risk induced by climate change. The key findings include: 1) systemic risk induced by climate change derives from the rapid growth of greenhouse gas emissions, increasingly complex connections among different socioeconomic systems, and continuous changes in exposure and vulnerability; 2) systemic risk induced by climate change is a holistic risk generated by the interconnection, interaction, and dynamic evolution of different types of single risks, and its fundamental, defining feature is cascading effects. The extent of risk propagation and its duration depend on the characteristics of the various discrete risks that are connected to make up the systemic risk; 3) impact domains, severity of impact, and probability of occurrences are three core indicators in systemic risk assessment, and the impact domains should include the economy, society, homeland security, human health, and living conditions. We propose to deepen systemic risk research from three aspects: to develop theories to understand the mechanism of systemic risk; to conduct empirical research to assess future risks; and to develop countermeasures to mitigate the risk.

J	Li, LL; Li, J; Yu, RC				LI, Liang-Liang; Li, Jian; Yu, Ru-Cong			Evaluation of CMIP6 HighResMIP models in simulating precipitation over Central Asia	ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH			English	Article						CMIP6 HighResMIP; Model evaluation; Precipitation; Elevation; Central Asia	CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER-RESOURCES; RESOLUTION; MOUNTAINS; IMPACTS; TRENDS; SHAN	The High Resolution Model Intercomparison Project (HighResMIP) experiment within the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), for the first time, has provided an opportunity to evaluate the performance of climate models over complex topographies. Based on the HighResMIP's historical simulations of atmospheric general circulation models, the performances of global high-resolution models, with a horizontal resolution finer than 50 km, in representing precipitation over Central Asia were evaluated using rain gauge observation datasets. All the models successfully reproduce the large precipitation regions that are located over the mountainous areas and Northern Central Asia. However, nearly all the models overestimate precipitation frequency over Central Asia and large overestimations of precipitation amount and frequency are located over the mountainous areas. Although the HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean performs better than all individual models at simulating the spatial pattern of precipitation frequency, it is inferior to HadGEM3-GC31-HM and ECMWF-IFS-HR at simulating that of precipitation amount. The simulation performance exhibits remarkable regional differences. Over the Qilian Mountains, the relationship between precipitation and elevation is totally captured by climate models. In contrast, over the Tianshan Mountains, the models fail to simulate the decrease in precipitation frequency after elevation higher than the maximum precipitation elevation. Most models successfully reproduce the annual cycle shape of precipitation amount over the Southern Central Asia, Qilian Mountains and Tianshan Mountains, but fail to reproduce it over the Northern Central Asia. More than half of the high-resolution GCMs have a reduced bias relative to the corresponding low-resolution GCMs. The performances of most high-resolution GCMs in simulating precipitation pattern are well over the Tianshan Mountains.

There is an increased need for an in-depth understanding of the evolution of permafrost temperature (Ttop) and active-layer thickness (ALT) at a fine scale on the QTP under climate change. This study evaluated the permafrost thermal development over the QTP for the period 1980-2100 at a 1 km(2) scale using a physically analytical model accounting for both climatic and local environmental factors based on multi-source data. The model results were validated against thermal borehole measurements and baseline maps. The modeled current (2001-2018) permafrost area (Ttop <= 0 degrees C) covers 1.42 x 106 km(2) (ca. 56.1% of the QTP land area), 10.1% of which thawed over the historical period 1981-2000. To assess how the ground thermal regime could develop in the future, we utilized the multi-model ensemble mean of downscaled outputs from eight climate models under three Shared Socio-economic Pathways (i.e., SSP126, 245, and 585) in CMIP6 to force the permafrost model. Model results suggest that the current (2001-2018) permafrost extent is likely to dramatically contract in the future period (2021-2100), as indicated by consistent Ttop warming and ALT increasing due to climate changing. About 26.9%, 59.9%, 80.1% of the current permafrost is likely to disappear by the end of the 21st century under SSP126, SSP245, and SSP585 scenarios, respectively. The simulation results may further provide new opportunities to assess the future impacts of climate warming on environments and engineering development over the QTP.

Climate models of the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) show a much stronger Arctic warming signal but with a larger inter-model spread. In this study, we find that the projected Arctic warming made by multi-models in CMIP6 is positively correlated with the simulated global warming trend during the period of 1981-2011 in historical runs. This enables us to tighter constraints to future warming in the Arctic by using the observed global warming during the instrument era. The fact that CMIP6 models tend to overestimate the trend of global mean surface temperature during 1981-2011, therefore, would imply a relative weak Arctic warming compared to the CMIP6 median warming projection.

We ran simulations of the Common Land Model (CoLM) to obtain the photosynthetic rate, and used the satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), to which we applied a temporal sensitivity analysis, the slope change ratio of accumulative quantity (SCRAQ), and geographical detectors. We show that the discrepancy between warming and precipitation variation contributed to vegetation activity was more notable than the ecosystem sensitivity to hydrothermal conditions, regardless of which temporal and spatial scale was considered. The sensitivity of vegetation activity to hydrothermal variation in most parts of northeastern and western China was higher than elsewhere, and the contribution of warming to vegetation dynamics was relatively high in the Inner Mongolian Plateau and Tibetan Plateau (>60%), where the contribution of warming to the vegetation distribution was also greater than elsewhere in China. Conversely, the contribution of precipitation variation to vegetation dynamics was comparatively greater in northwestern China and subtropical and tropical regions (>55%). The spatiotemporal contribution of precipitation variation to vegetation activity differed between regions, especially on the Tibetan Plateau and in subtropical and tropical regions. Moreover, both the temporal and spatial sensitivities to climate change were weak in the subtropical and tropical regions, where the contribution of climatic factors to vegetation distribution was also small. Overall, temperature sensitivity and its contribution to vegetation activity were positively associated in most regions. However, the regions where precipitation contributed substantially to vegetation activity were not necessarily also highly sensitive to changes in precipitation within the range of variation explored.

Reliable data and information on snow depth and snow water equivalent (SWE) are also crucial for water resource assessments and socio-economic development at local and regional scales. However, these data are extremely limited and unreliable in northern Xinjiang, China. This study thus aims to investigate spatial variations of snow depth, SWE, and snow density based on winter snowfield surveys during 2015 through 2017 in the Altai Mountains, northwestern China. The results indicated that snow depth (25-114 cm) and SWE (40-290 mm) were greater in the alpine Kanas-Hemu region, and shallow snow accumulated (9-42 cm for snow depth, 26-106 mm for SWE) on the piedmont sloping plain. While there was no remarkable regional difference in the distribution of snow density. Snow property distributions were strongly controlled by topography and vegetation. Elevation and latitude were the most important factors affecting snow depth and SWE, while snow density was strongly affected by longitude across the Altai Mountains in China. The influence of topography on snow property distributions was spatially heterogenous. Mean snow depth increased from 13.7 to 31.2 cm and SWE from 28.5 to 79.9 mm, respectively, with elevation increased from 400 to 1000 m a.s.l. on the piedmont sloping plain. Snow depth decreased to about 15.1 cm and SWE to about 28.5 mm from 1000 to 1800 m a.s.l., then again increased to about 98.1 cm and 271.7 mm on peaks (2000 m a.s.l.) in the alpine Kanas-Hemu. Leeward slopes were easier to accumulate snow cover, especially on north-, east-, and southeast-facing slopes. Canopy interception was also the cause of the difference in snow distribution. Snow depth, SWE, and snow density in forests were reduced by 8%-53%, 2%-67% and -4% to +48%, respectively, compared with surrounding open areas. Especially when snow depth was less than 40 cm, snow depth and SWE differences in forests were more exaggerated. This study provides a basic data set of spatial distributions and variations of snow depth, SWE and snow density in the Altai Mountains, which can be used as an input parameter in climate or hydrological models. These first-hand observations will help to better understand the relationship between snow, topography and climate in mountainous regions across northern China and other high-mountain Asian regions.

Firstly, evaluation indicated that CENS could better reproduce the long-term mean and interannual variability of surface wind speed over China compared to the original simulation outputs, providing a reliable basis for future projections. Projection of the averaged wind power density of China showed a decreasing trend during 2020-2099 in all four seasons under all three scenarios, with the significant (p < 0.05) magnitude apparent in both autumn and winter, characterized by an increase over South China and a decrease over northwestern and southwestern regions. In addition, the 'very abundant' and 'abundant' categories of available wind energy located in northern China and the low-speed wind energy in South China were projected to decrease by the middle and late of the 21st century. Although the projected decrease in annual wind power density ranged from 1.14% to -0.36% per decade among the three scenarios, we believe that, considering the strong inter-annual variability and uncertainty involved, these changes would not substantially affect China's future wind energy plans. Also of note was that a low emission scenario could to some extent mitigate the reduction in wind energy potential in the future. Furthermore, we suggest that implementation of newly developed wind power technology should consider the impact of changes in wind energy in different sub-regions (e.g., the low wind speed region over South China), which is pivotal to China's strategic planning in this sector.

Meanwhile, recent observations show that the governance architecture for carbon neutrality is transforming to polycentricity. However, there is still a lack of systematic investigation on carbon neutrality governance under the polycentric approach. Against this background, this study attempts to investigate the emergence and structure of polycentric climate governance, and to figure out to what extent the evolving polycentric system can contribute to the climate change governance towards carbon neutrality. The results show that efforts made by actors at transnational and subnational levels within the polycentric system can greatly complement the deficits of carbon neutrality governance by international regime and state government in many different domains. Besides, the identified issues, that are critical to carbon neutrality including climate legislation, adaptation, technology deployment and data authenticity and transparency, can be addressed in a more effective way through the coordination among multiple actors at multiple levels. Finally, further research should be conducted to address the dynamic linkages between international regimes as well as the issues related to small and medium-sized cities, and develop a comprehensive evaluation and accounting system for the risks and benefits of polycentric climate governance.

Consequently, to raise environmental resilience and sustain human wellbeing, we need to overhaul the policy-making process towards a 'holistic approach'. The nexus approach has proven a valuable tool for identifying gaps and incoherencies in current policies, for understanding major interlinkages across sectors and scales, and for promoting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Nevertheless, a 'silo approach' to decision making currently prevails, thus achieving cross-sectoral and cross-scale harmonization still remains a challenge in policy-making. In response to this challenge, the next step in the science-policy-practice interface is to integrate the nexus approach in the 'climate services' arena, in order to support integrated policies. Climate services embody a bridge between researchers and stakeholders, and by supporting integrated policies they will ensure synergies between sectors and scales, reduce potential trade-offs, and enable co-benefits.

The overall trend is of shrubland and tree lines moving northwards, while changes in different land cover types and vegetation growth in response to climate change are largely unknown. Here, we selected land areas with latitudes higher than 50 degrees N as the study area. We compared the land cover type changes and explored relationships between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values of different land cover types, air temperature, and precipitation during 1982-2015 based on dynamic grid. The results indicated that forest and shrubland areas increased as a large area of grassland shifted to forest and shrubland. The snow/ice, tundra and grassland largely have decreased from 1982 to 2015. Although approximately 277.3 x 10(3) km(2) of barren land (6.2% of the total barren land area in 1982) changed to tundra, the tundra area still decreased because some tundra shifted to forest and grassland. The NDVI values of tundra significantly increased, but the shrubland showed a decreasing trend. Temperature in the growing season (June to September) showed the largest positive correlation coefficients with the NDVI values of forest, tundra, grassland, and cropland. However, due to shrubification processes and plant mortality in shrubland areas, the shrubland NDVI showed negative relationship with annual temperature but positively correlated with monthly t. Taken together, although there is large room for improvement of the land cover type data accuracy, our results suggested that the land cover types in high-latitude regions changed significantly, while the NDVI values of the different land cover types showed different responses to climate change.

Many studies on drought in CA, as a whole, have been carried out, whereas there is a lack of studies on the drying and wetting trends of different climatic zones within CA. In this study, CA was divided into three different climatic zones based on the Koppen climate classification method, precipitation climatology, and aridity index. These were the temperate continental (Df), dry arid desert (BW), and Mediterranean continental (Ds) climatic zones. The regional drying and wetting trends during the years 1961-2015 were investigated using the monthly gridded Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). The empirical orthogonal function (EOF) was applied to analyze spatial and temporal variation patterns. EOF mode 1 (EOF1) analysis found increasingly wet conditions throughout CA over the duration of the study, and EOF mode 2 (EOF2) analysis found a contrast between northern and southern CA: as Df became drier and BW and Ds became wetter. EOF mode 3 (EOF3) analysis found a western and eastern inverse phase distribution. The SPEI displayed a decreasing trend from 1961 to 1974 for CA as a whole, before increasing from 1975 to 2015, with a particularly significant increase over the first seven years of that period. On a regional scale, the BW and Ds zones experienced a wetting trend due to increased precipitation during 1961-2015, but the Df zone experienced a drying trend due to reduced evapotranspiration and an increasing temperature, particularly from 1961 to 1978. Thus, the spatio-temporal patterns in dryness and wetness across CA can be categorized according to climatic regions.

However, current knowledge of climatic responses and regional contributions to the interannual variability (IAV) of global burned area remains limited. Using recent satellite-derived wildfire products and simulations from version v1.0 of the land component of the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM land model [ELM] v1) driven by three different climate forcings, we investigated the burned area IAV and its climatic sensitivity globally and across nine biomes from 1997 to 2018. We found that 1) the ELM simulations generally agreed with the satellite observations in terms of the burned area IAV magnitudes, regional contributions, and covariations with climate factors, confirming the robustness of the ELM to the usage of different climate forcing sources; 2) tropical savannas, tropical forests, and semi-arid grasslands near deserts were primary contributors to the global burned area IAV, collectively accounting for 71.7%-99.7% of the global wildfire IAV estimated by both the satellite observations and ELM simulations; 3) precipitation was a major fire suppressing factor and dominated the global and regional burned area IAVs, and temperature and shortwave solar radiation were mostly positively related with burned area IAVs; and 4) noticeable local discrepancies between the ELM and remote-sensing results occurred in semi-arid grasslands, croplands, boreal forests, and wetlands, likely caused by uncertainties in the current ELM fire scheme and the imperfectly derived satellite observations. Our findings revealed the spatiotemporal diversity of wildfire variations, regional contributions and climatic responses, and provided new metrics for wildfire modeling, facilitating the wildfire prediction and management.

There is increasing evidence that many of the glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau have also shown periodically dynamic behaviour in the form of glacier surging and some even catastrophic collapse events. In this study, we examine the prevalence of glacier surging at the Geladandong ice caps, North East Tibetan Plateau, to better understand the role of surge events in the evolution of glacier mass loss budgets. Using glacier surface elevation change data over the period 1969-2018 and glacier surface velocity data from the ITS_LIVE dataset, we find that 19 outlet glaciers of the ice caps are of surge-type. Our multi-temporal measurements of glacier mass balance show that surge-type glacier mass budgets vary depending on the portion of the surge-cycle captured by geodetic data. At the regional level, pre- and post-surge glacier mass loss variability does not bias regional mass budget estimates, but enhanced, or suppressed, mass loss estimates are likely when small groups of glaciers are examined. Our results emphasise the importance of accurate surge-type glacier inventories and the need to maximise geodetic data coverage over glacierised regions known to contain surge-type glaciers.

In this study, we analyzed the spatial and temporal variations of the ground surface freezing and thawing indices from 1900 to 2017 for the upper Brahmaputra River (also called the Yarlung Zangbo River in China) Basin (UBRB), southwestern Tibetan Plateau, with the air freezing and thawing indices using the University of Delaware (UDEL) monthly gridded air temperature dataset. The abrupt change years for air freezing index (AFI) and ground surface freezing index (GFI) were detected in 1999 and 2002, respectively, and for both air thawing index (ATI) and ground surface thawing index (GTI) were 2009. With the air temperature rising at a rate of 0.006 degrees C per year over 1900-2017, the AFI and GFI decreased at a rate of -0.1 degrees C d per year, while the ATI and GTI increased at rates of 0.3 and 0.5 degrees C d per year before the abrupt change year, respectively; all changing trends of freezing/thawing indices increased after the abrupt year, which was -2.9, -0.8, 7.3, and 21.7 degrees C d per year for the AFI, GFI, ATI, and GTI, respectively. We utilized the surface frost number model to obtain the dynamics of the frozen ground over the UBRB. When the empirical coefficient of E was assigned to 1.2, the simulated frozen ground occupied about 53.2% of the whole UBRB in the 1990s, which agreed well with the existing permafrost map published in 1996. The area of frozen ground accounts for 51.5%-54.5% of the UBRB during 1900-2017. This result may facilitate further studies of the multi-interactions among the frozen ground and relevant eco-environment, such as the air-ground surface energy exchange, hydrological cycles, and changes of the active layer thickness over the UBRB.

As a common thermal disaster in permafrost regions, thermokarst lake has serious thermal erosion on permafrost and results in permafrost degradation aggravating. This study focused on two subgrade cross-sections of Gonghe-Yushu Highway in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau to analyze thermal effect of thermokarst lake on the permafrost under embankment. The analysis infers that thermokarst lake can transfer heat to permafrost under the embankment, as a heat resource, and the heat flux decreases with the distance away from thermokarst lake in horizontal and vertical direction. Thermokarst lake can cause average ground temperature of permafrost under the embankment increasing, and with less distance from the thermokarst lake the temperature increases more severely. Thermokarst lake results in 14 m thickness melting interlayer in soil under lake and change shape of melting area.

We aim to compare the differences in surface air temperature (SAT) between observational that has been adjusted for urbanization bias and reanalysis data (NCEPV1, NCEPV2, ERA5, CFSR, MERRA, JRA55, 20CRV3 and CRA40) over mainland China during 1961-2015. The main results are presented as follows. The correlation and standard deviation between the reanalysis data and observations exhibit highly consistent interannual variability and dispersion, with the interannual SAT variability in JRA55 being closest to the observations for 1961-2015 and that of ERA5 for 1979-2015; the dispersions of 20CRV3 is most consistent with the observations for 1961-2015 and that of NCEPV1 for 1979-2015. Although annual mean SAT of the reanalysis is generally 0-2.0 degrees C lower than the observations, the bias in the SAT climatology of 20CRV3 is the least for 1961-2015 in all reanalysis datasets and that of CRA40 is the least for 1979-2015. The trends of NCEPV1 is closer to the observations than other reanalysis for 1961-2015 and that of 20CRV3 for 1979-2015. The biases in terms of interannual variability, dispersion, climatology, and linear trend are increase with altitude. Overall, in terms of the similarity of multiple measures to the urbanization bias-adjusted observations, JRA55 and CRA40 show the best performances for the periods 1961-2015 and 1979-2015 respectively in reproducing various aspects of climatological and climate change features in mainland China.

In this study, we used the simulations of the regional climate model REMO with 25 km spatial resolution, driven by three different global climate models (MPI-ESM-MR, NorESM1-M, and HadGEM2-ES), to evaluate how annual and seasonal mean surface air temperature and precipitation in the QM are likely to change for three future periods (2011-2040, 2041-2070, and 2071-2100) under two representative concentration pathways (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). The REMO model, shows noticeable cold and wet biases compared to observations for the reference period (1971-2000) and air temperature simulation outperforms precipitation simulation. The REMO simulations exhibit a warm and wet centre around lake, indicating that the simulation are likely influenced by lake. Projections under RCP2.6 show regional warming reaching 1.74 ??C during 2011-2100, characterized by an initial increase and a decrease afterwards. Under RCP8.5, air temperatures increase monotonously from 2011 to 2100, with a warming magnitude of 5.36 ??C for 2071-2100 relative to 1971-2000. The overall change in regionalaverage annual precipitation is not evident during 2011-2100, with some increases or decreases in certain time periods. In the 2071-2100 both the strongest warming and precipitation increase are projected to occur in winter under both scenarios, while precipitation in summer and autumn is projected to decrease in the east of the QM for the three future periods. The results suggest that the QM is likely to experience drought conditions in warm seasons in the future, which could impact agricultural and livestock production.

A series of heavy rains that began on July 31st, 2018, battered the Hami prefecture of eastern Xinjiang, China for four days. These rains sparked devastating floods, caused 20 deaths, eight missing, and the evacuation of about 5500 people. This study examines the extreme rainfall event in a historical context and explores the anthropogenic causes based on analysis of multiple datasets (i.e., the observed daily data, the global climate models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis 1, and the satellite cloud data) and several statistical techniques. Results show that this extraordinarily heavy rainfall was due mainly to the abnormal weather system (e.g., the abnormal subtropical high) that transported abundant water vapor from the Indian Ocean and the East China Sea crossed the high mountains and formed extreme rainfall in Hami prefecture, causing the reservoir to break and form a flood event with treat loss, which is a typical example of a comprehensive analysis of the extreme rainfall event in summer in Northwest China. Also, the fraction of attributable risk (FAR) value was 1.00 when the 2018 July-August RX1day (11.52 mm) was marked as the threshold, supporting the claim of a significant anthropogenic influence on the risk of this extreme rainfall. The results offer insights into the variability of precipitation extremes in arid areas contributing to better manage water-related disasters.

The spread of snails not only depends on the degree of warming but also on the socioeconomic development of the next few decades. Shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) published by CMIP6 consider carbon emission pathways as well as influences of distinct types of social development and land use on the regional climate, providing the possibility to accurately evaluate the impact of socioeconomic development and climate variation on the spread of O. hupensis. This study employed SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585 and the correlative approach to explore the impacts of climate change and socioeconomic development on the potential diffusion areas for O. hupensis in China. The results exhibited strong evidence that O. hupensis will spread in the north of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and disappear from a small part of its current southern habitat, whereas in Sichuan and Yunnan, O. hupensis may spread slightly to the southeast. The projection also demonstrated that fossil fuel-driven development (SSP585) will be more conducive to the spread of O. hupensis breeding sites in the 2030s, whereas the continuous increase in snail breeding habitats under the regional rivalry path (SSP370) may lead to great challenges in snail control in the long term (2020-2080).

By analyzing 491,279 climate-change-related tweets, we found that social bots were actively engaged in climate change discussions on Twitter and contributed up to 1.5.4% of related contents. Bots promote the saliency of energy, climate actions and climate strikes on public agenda. 83.1% of tweets posted by social bots support climate change activism, and 16.9% support climate change skepticism. However, social bot skeptics are more strategical than social bot activists in terms of launching conversations with opposing-minded humans, and avoiding amplification of opposing voices. They are also more successful in inciting opposing-minded humans' initiative conversation and like-minded humans' amplification. Based on the above findings, we suggest cultivating individuals' media literacy in terms of distinguishing malicious social bots as a potential solution to deal with social bot skeptics disguised as humans, as well as making use of benign social bots for science popularization.

It is generally believed that global warming drives increase in frequency, intensity and duration of climate extremes, and socioeconomic exposure plays a dominant role in climate impacts. In order to promote climate risk governance at regional level, the historical and projected trends in the population exposure to climate extremes are quantified in eastern China using downscaled climate simulations and population growth scenarios. The frequency of temperature extremes (tx35days) is projected to more than double by 2050 in nearly half of prefecture-level cities in eastern China, leading to an 81.8% increment of total exposure under SSP2-4.5 scenario. The increasing trend is also detectable in the frequency of precipitation extremes (r20mm) in eastern China, and the exposure increment is projected to be 22.9% by 2050, with a near equivalent contributions of both climate change and population growth. Spatially, temperature exposure mainly grows in southern Hebei, western Shandong and inland Guangdong provinces, while precipitation exposure raises principally in southeast coastal areas of China. Based on the historical baseline and projected amplification of population exposure, we identify some hotspot cities such as Guangzhou, Shanghai, Dongguan and Hangzhou that response to climate change dramatically and confront greater potential risk of climate extremes in the coming future.
