Heavy cyanobacterial blooms outbreak in Lake Taihu in summer annually and vanish in other months. To find out the factors impacting the cyanobacterial blooms, the present study measured the physicochemical parameters of water and investigated the composition of microbial community using the 16S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer amplicon sequencing in the months with or without bloom. The most interesting finding is that two major cyanobacteria, Planktothrix and Microcystis, dramatically alternated during a cyanobacterial bloom in 2016, which is less mentioned in previous studies. When the temperature of the water began increasing in July, Planktothrix appeared first and showed as a superior competitor for M. aeruginosa in NO3--rich conditions. Microcystis became the dominant genus when the water temperature increased further in August. Laboratory experiments confirmed the influence of temperature and the total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) form on the growth of Planktothrix and Microcystis in a co-culture system. Besides, species interactions between cyanobacteria and non-cyanobacterial microorganisms, especially the prokaryotes, also played a key role in the alteration of Planktothrix and Microcystis. The present study exhibited the alteration of two dominant cyanobacteria in the different bloom periods caused by the temperature, TDN forms as well as the species interactions. These results helped the better understanding of cyanobacterial blooms and the factors which contribute to them.

There is a great controversy about controlling only phosphorus or controlling both nitrogen and phosphorus in the management of lake eutrophication. The primary argument against the dual nutrients control of eutrophication is that nitrogen fixation can compensate the nitrogen deficits. Thus, it is of great necessary to study the factors that can significantly affect the nitrogen fixation. Due to the difference of climate and human influence, the water quality of different lakes (such as water temperature, N:P ratio and water residence time) is also quite different. Numerous studies have reported that the low N:P ratio can intensify the nitrogen fixation capacities. However, the effects of temperature and water residence time on the nitrogen fixation remain unclear. Thus, 30 shallows freshwater lakes in the eastern plain of China were selected to measure dissolved N-2 and Ar concentrations through N-2: Ar method using a membrane inlet mass spectrometer to quantify the nitrogen fixation capacities and investigate whether the temperature and water residence time have a great impact on nitrogen fixation. The results have shown that the short lake water residence time can severely inhibit the nitrogen fixation capacities through inhibiting the growth of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, changing the N:P ratio and resuspending the solids from sediments. Similarly, lakes with low water temperature also have a low nitrogen fixation capacity, suggesting that controlling nitrogen in such lakes is feasible if the growth of cyanobacteria is limited by nitrogen.

However, there was limited research about the removal mechanism of azole fungicides in the biological treatment of WWTPs. Imidazole fungicide climbazole and triazole fungicide fluconazole were selected to investigate the biodegradation mechanism of azole fungicides in activated sludge under aerobic conditions. Climbazole was found to be adsorbed to solid sludge and resulted in quick biodegradation. The degradation of climbazole in the aerobic activated sludge system was fitted well by the first-order kinetic model with a half-life of 5.3 days, while fluconazole tended to stay in liquid and had only about 30% of loss within 77 days incubation. Ten biotransformation products of climbazole were identified by high resolution mass spectrometry using suspect and non-target screening method. But no biodegradation products of fluconazole were identified due to its limited removal. The possible biodegradation pathways for climbazole were proposed based on the products identification and pathway prediction system, and involves oxidative dehalogenation, side chain oxidation and azole ring loss. The findings from this study suggest that it should be a concern for the persistence of fluconazole in the environment.

African continent is faced with the unique challenge of climate change whilst coping with extreme poverty, explosive population growth and economic difficulties. CO2 emission patterns in Africa are analysed in this study to understand primary CO2 sources and underlying driving forces further. Data are examined using gravity model, logarithmic mean divisia index and Tapio's decoupling indicator of CO2 emissions from economic development in 20 selected African countries during 1984-2014. Results reveal that CO2 emissions increased by 2.11% (453.73 million ton) over the research period. Gravity centre for African CO2 emissions had shifted towards the northeast direction. Population and economic growth were primary driving forces of CO2 emissions. Industrial structure and emission efficiency effects partially offset the growth of CO2 emissions. The economic growth effect was an offset factor in central African countries and Zimbabwe due to political instability and economic mismanagement. Industrial structure and emission efficiency were insufficient to decouple economic development from CO2 emissions and relieve the pressure of population explosion on CO2 emissions in Africa. Thus, future efforts in reducing CO2 emissions should focus on scaleup energy-efficient technologies, renewable energy update, emission pricing and long-term green development towards sustainable development goals by 2030.

This study aimed to explore the impacts of disturbances (e.g. human activity, temperature, precipitation, and water level) on phytoplankton community structure (i.e. community evenness and community composition) and function (i.e. resource use efficiency) in four subtropical reservoirs over 7 years from 2010 to 2016. Our results showed that community turnover (measured as community dissimilarity) was positively related to disturbance frequency, but no significant correlation was found between phytoplankton biodiversity (i.e. evenness) and disturbance frequency. Phytoplankton resource use efficiency (RUE = phytoplankton biomass/ total phosphorus) was increased with a higher frequency of disturbance with an exception of cyanobacteria. The RUE of Cyanobacteria and diatoms showed significantly negative correlations with their community evenness, while the RUE of Chlorophyta exhibited a positive correlation with their community turnover. We suggest that multiple environmental disturbances may play crucial roles in shaping the structure and functioning of plankton communities in subtropical reservoirs, and mechanism of this process can provide key information for freshwater uses, management and conservation.

To test the relationships between submerged macrophyte presence and the ratio of Secchi disk depth (SDD) to water depth, i.e. SDD/depth, nutrients and wind, we conducted an extensive sampling campaign in a macrophyte-dominated area of the eastern region (n = 36) in 2016 in Lake Taihu, China, and combined the data gathered with results from extensive physico-chemical monitoring data from the entire lake. We confirmed that SDD/Depth is the primary factor controlling the community composition of macrophytes and showed that plant abundance increased with increasing SDD/Depth ratio (p < 0.01), but that only SDD/Depth > 0.4 ensured growth of submerged macrophytes. Total phosphorus and total nitrogen also influenced the growth and community composition of macrophytes (p < 0.01), while Chla was an indirectly affecting factor by reducing underwater light penetration. Wave height significantly influenced plant abundance (p < 0.01), whereas it had little effect on the biomass (p > 0.05). The key to restore the macrophyte beds in the lake is to reduce the nutrient loading. A decrease of the water level may contribute as well in the shallow bays but will not bring plants back in the main part of the lake. As the tolerance of shade and nutrients varied among the species studied, this should be taken into account in the restoration of lakes by addition of plants.

The long-term ingestion of groundwater containing high concentrations of fluoride is one of the main causes of fluorosis. We used artificial neural network to model the relationship between groundwater fluoride concentrations from throughout China and environmental variables such as climatic, geological. and soil parameters as proxy predictors. The results show that the accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the model in the test dataset are 80.5% and 0.86%, respectively, and climatic variables are the most effective predictors. Based on the artificial neural network model, a nationwide prediction risk map of fluoride concentrations exceeding 1.5 mg/L with a 0.5 x 0.5 arc minutes resolution was generated. The high risk areas are mainly located in western provinces of Xinjiang, Tibet, Qinghai, and Sichuan, and the northern provinces of Inner Mongolia, Hebei and Shandong. The total number of people estimated to be potentially at risk of fluorosis due to the use of untreated high fluoride groundwater as drinking water is about 89 million, or 6% of the population. The high fluoride groundwater risk map helps the authorities to prioritize areas requiring mitigation measures and thus facilitates the implementation of water improvement and defluoridation projects.

The assessment of air pollution - related Baikal's ecosystem damage is an unsolved problem. Ship, based expedition exploring the Baikal atmospheric aerosol loading, was performed over the lake area in July 2018. We combine the aerosol near - water and vertical distributions over the Lake Baikal basin with meteorological observations and air mass transportation simulations. Lidar sounding of aerosol fields in the troposphere assesses the atmospheric background in the pristine areas and the pollution during fire-affected periods. Aerosol optical properties (scattering and spectral absorption) converted to the particle number size, black carbon (BC) mass, and Absorption Angstrom Exponent (AAE) provide the inside into aerosol characterization. Transport of industrial emissions from Krasnoyarsk and Irkutsk regions, and wildfire plumes from Republic of Yakutia relates the pollution sources to the increased concentrations of fine particle numbers, PM10 and BC mass over Southern and Northern/Central Baikal, respectively. The highest PM10 and BC are associated to the harbor and touristic areas of intensive shipping and residential biomass burning. Deposition estimates applied to aerosol data exhibit the pollution fluxes to water surface over the whole Baikal area. AAE marks the impact of coal combustion, residential biomass burning, and wildfires indicating the high pollution level of the Lake Baikal ecological system.

In this work, we reported the absorption properties and potential source of BrC based on a seven-wavelength aethalometer in the winter of 2018-2019 at an urban site of Sanmenxia in Fenwei Plain in central China. Specifically, the mean value of BrC absorption coefficient was 59.6 +/- 36.0 Mm(-1) at 370 nm and contributed 37.7% to total absorption, which made a significant impact on visibility and regional environment. Absorption coefficients of BrC showed double-peak pattern, and BrC had shown small fluctuations under haze days compared with clean days. As for the sources of BrC, BrC absorption coefficients expressed strong correlations with element carbon aerosols and primary organic carbon aerosols, indicating that most of BrC originated from primary emissions. The linear correlations between trace metal elements (K, As, Fe, Mn, Zn, and Pb) and BrC absorption coefficients further referred that the major sources of BrC were primary emissions, like coal burning, biomass burning, and vehicle emissions. The moderate relationship between BrC absorption coefficients and secondary organic aerosols suggested that secondary production of BrC also played an important role. The 120 hr backward air mass trajectories analysis and concentration-weighted trajectories analysis were also used to investigate potential sources of BrC in and around this area, which inferred most parts of BrC were derived from local emissions.

Improved quantitative characterization of long-term CO trends is important for both atmospheric modeling and the design and implementation of policies to efficiently control multiple pollutants. Due to the limitations of high time-resolution and high-quality long-term observational data, studies on long-term trends in the CO concentration in China are quite limited. In this study, the observational data of the concentration of CO in a rural site of Beijing during 2006-2018 was used to analyze the long-term trend in CO concentration in Beijing. The Theil-Sen method and the generalized additive model (GAM)-based method, were used to conduct the trend estimation analysis. We found that the concentration of CO at the Shangdianzi site showed a significant downward trend during 2006-2018, with a decline rate of 22.8 +/- 5.1 ppbV per year. The declining trend in CO also showed phasic characteristics, with a fast decreasing rate during the period of 2006-2008, stable variations during the period of 2009-2013 and a continuous downward trend after 2013. The declining trend in the CO concentration in the south to west (S-W) sectors where the polluted air masses come from is more rapid than that in the sectors where the clean air masses come from. The declining trend in the CO concentration implies the improved combustion efficiency and the successful air pollution control policies in Beijing and the surrounding area.

However, our understanding of PM and its chemical compositions in Beijing under the current atmospheric environment is still not complete after witnessing marked alleviation during 2013-2017. Continuous measurements can be crucial for further air quality improvement by better characterizing PM pollution and chemical compositions in Beijing. Here, we conducted simultaneous measurements on PM in Beijing during 2018-2019. Results indicate that annual mean PM1.0 and PM2.5 concentrations were 35.49 +/- 18.61 mu g/m(3) and 66.58 +/- 60.17 mu g/m(3), showing a positive response to emission controls. The contribution of sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium (SNA) played an enhanced role with elevated PM loading and acted as the main contributors to pollution episodes. Discrepancies observed among chemical species between PM1.0 and PM2.5 in spring suggest that sand particles trend to accumulate in the range of 1-2.5 mu m. Pollution episodes occurred accompanied with southerly clusters and high formation of SNA by heterogeneous reactions in summer and winter, respectively. Results from positive matrix factorization (PMF) combined with potential source contribution function (PSCF) models showed that potential areas were seasonal dependent, secondary and vehicular sources became much more important compared with previous studies in Beijing. Our study presented a continuous investigation on PM and sources origins in Beijing, which provides a better understanding for further emission control as well as a reference for other cities in developing countries.

Almost 90% of river samples were supersaturated in CO2 with a mean f standard deviation of 1474 +/- 1614 mu atm, leading to emissions of 557 - 971 mmol/m(2)/day from river water to the atmosphere. Annual CO2 emissions were 1.6 - 2.8 times greater than the longitudinal exports of riverine dissolved inorganic and organic carbon. pCO(2) was positively correlated to anthropogenic land use (urban and farmland), and negatively correlated to forest cover. pCO(2) also had significant and positive relationships with total dissolved nitrogen and total dissolved phosphorus. Stepwise multiple regression models were developed to predict pCO(2). Farmland and urban land released nutrients and organic matter to the river system, driving riverine pCO(2) enrichment due to enhanced respiration in these heterotrophic rivers. Overall, we show the crucial role of land use driving riverine pCO(2), which should be considered in future large-scale estimates of CO2 emissions from streams. Land use change can thus modify the carbon balance of urban-river systems by enhancing river emissions, and reforestation helps carbon neutral in rivers.

In this study, the particle number size distributions, and the frequency of NPF events over Hefei were investigated from November 2018 to February 2019. The proportions of the nucleation mode, Aitken mode, and accumulation mode were 24.59%, 53.10%, and 22.30%, respectively, which indicates the presence of abundant ultrafine particles in Hefei. Forty-six NPF events occurred during the observation days, accounting for 41.82% of the entire observation period. Moreover, the favorable meteorological conditions, potential precursor gases, and PM2.5 range of the NPF events were analyzed. Compared to non-NPF days, the NPF events preferentially occurred on days with lower relative humidity, higher wind speeds, and higher temperatures. When the PM2.5 was 15-20, 70-80, and 105-115 mu g/m3, the frequency of the NPF events was higher. Nucleation mode particles were positively related to atmospheric oxidation indicated by ozone when PM2.5 ranged from 15 to 20 mu g/m3, and related to gaseous precursors like SO2 and NO2 when PM2.5 was located at 70-80 and 105-115 mu g/m3. On pollution days, NPF events did not directly contribute to the increase in the PM2.5 in the daytime, however, NPF events would occur during the night and the growth of particulate matter contributes to the nighttime PM2.5 contents. This could lead to pollution that lasted into the next day. These findings are significant to the improvement of our understanding of the effects of aerosols on air quality.

In this study, three different receptor models (including the principal component analysis-multiple linear regression (PCA-MLR), positive matrix factorization (PMF), and Unmix models) were used to apportion the sources of 16 priority PAHs in a sediment core of Lake Dagze Co. The EPAHs (sum of all 16 measured PAHs) concentrations ranged from 51.89 to 132.82 ng/g with an average of 80.39 ng/g. The EPAHs were dominated by 2-3 ring PAHs, accounting for 80.12% on average, thereby indicating that they mainly originated from biomass and coal combustion and/or from long-range atmospheric transportation. The three models produced consistent source apportionment results. The greatest contributor to EPAHs was biomass combustion, followed by coal combustion, vehicle emissions, and petrogenic sources. Moreover, the temporal variation of the common sources was well-correlated among models. The multi-method comparison and evaluation results showed that all three models were useful tools for source apportionment of PAHs, with the PMF model providing better results than the PCA-MLR and Unmix models. The temporal trends of factor contributions were verified by PAHs with different ring numbers. Significant correlations were found between the simulated concentrations of each source factor , the PAHs with different ring numbers ( P < 0.01), except for the petrogenic source identified by the Unmix model ( P > 0.05). This study can provide useful information for further investigation of source apportionment of PAHs in the sediment cores.

The impact of the meteorological factors (temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, wind speed) was first estimated through principal component analysis, and then by stepwise multilinear regressions to include wind directions. The pollutants levels reflected the proximity of atmospheric emissions, in particular from a large industrial harbor. High humidity and mild temperatures, and in a lower extent low wind speed and rainfall, also favored higher concentration levels. The contributions of these meteorological aspects became minor when including wind direction, especially when approaching major emission sources. The bioaccumulation integration time towards meteorological variations was on a seasonal basis (1-2 months) but the wind direction and thus local emissions also relied on a longer time scale (12 months). This showed that the contribution of meteorological conditions may be prevalent in remote places, while secondary in polluted areas, and should be definitely taken into account regarding long-term lichen biomonitoring and inter-annual comparisons. In the same time, a quadruple sampling in each site revealed a high homogeneity among supporting tree species and topography. The resulting uncertainty, including sampling, preparation and analysis was below 30% when comfortable analytical conditions were achieved. Finally, the occurrence of unexpected events such as a major forest fire, permitted to evaluate that this type of short, although intense, events did not have a strong influence on PAH and metals bioaccumulation by lichen.

In particular, aerosols are more likely transformed and accumulated in winter. In this paper, we used the Multi-Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) instrument to study the characteristics of aerosol type and contributions of PM2.5 chemical components to aerosol extinction (AE), vertical distribution of aerosols, and source. From December 30, 2018 to January 27, 2019, we conducted MAX-DOAS observations on Sanmenxia. The proportion of PM2.5 to PM10 was 69.48%-95.39%, indicating that the aerosol particles were mainly fine particles. By analyzing the ion data and modifying Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) method, we found that nitrate was the largest contributor to AE, accounting for 31.51%, 28.98%, and 27.95% of AE on heavily polluted, polluted, and clean days, respectively. NH4+, OC, and SO42- were also major contributors to AE. The near-surface aerosol extinction retrieved from MAX-DOAS measurement the PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations measured by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) have the same trend in vertical distribution. AE increased about 3 times from surface to 500 m. With the backward trajectory of the air mass during the haze, we also found that the continuous heavy pollution was mainly caused by transport of polluted air from the northeast, then followed by local industrial emissions and other sources of emissions under continuous and steady weather conditions.

J	Zheng, JQ; Cao, XH; Ma, CZ; Weng, NY; Huo, SL				Zheng, Jiaqi; Cao, Xianghui; Ma, Chunzi; Weng, Nanyan; Huo, Shouliang			What drives the change of nitrogen and phosphorus loads in the Yellow River Basin during 2006-2017?	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Yellow river basin; Nutrient loads; Climate change; Non-point source; Point source	LARGE WATERSHEDS; TRANSPORT; CHINA; QUALITY; EUTROPHICATION; ACCUMULATION; LIVESTOCK; INPUTS; EXPORT	The Yellow River Basin (YRB) plays a very important role in China's economic and social development and ecological security. In particular, the ecosystem of the YRB is sensitive to climate change. However, the change of nutrient fluxes in this region during the past years and its main driving forces remain unclear. In this study, a hydrologic model R System for Spatially Referenced Regressions on Watershed Attributes (RSPARROW) was employed to simulate the spatio-temporal variations in the fluxes of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) during the period of 2006-2017. The results suggested that the TN and TP loads increased by 138% and 38% during 2006-2014, respectively, and decreased by 66% and 71% from 2015 to 2017, respectively. During the period of 2006-2017, the annual mean fluxes of TN and TP in the YRB were in the range of 3.9 to 591.6 kg/km(2)/year and 1.7 to 12.0 kg/km(2)/year, respectively. TN flux was low in the upstream area of the Yellow River, and presented a high level in the middle and lower reaches. However, the flux of TP in Gansu and Ningxia section was slightly higher than that in the lower reaches of the Yellow River. Precipitation and point source are the key drivers for the inter-annual changes of TN loads in most regions of the YRB. While the inter-annual variations of TP loads in the whole basin are mainly driven by the point source. This study demonstrates the important impacts of climate change on nutrient loads in the YRB. Moreover, management measures should be taken to reduce pollution sources and thus provide solid basis for control of nitrogen and phosphorus in the YRB.

Despite recent advances in our understanding of the effects of climate change on DIN in coastal waters, shallow high-latitude lakes exposed to large seasonal temperature differences have received limited research attention. Therefore, in the present study, Baiyangdian Lake (BYDL) was selected as the study area, as a typical high latitude shallow lake in North China. Based on water and sediment samples collected in spring, summer and winter seasons, DIN accumulation in sedimentary pore water and DIN diffusion fluxes at the sediment-water interface were quantified under different temperature conditions. Correlation analysis was used to establish the effects of temperature on DIN concentration and diffusion in different media. Results show that the diffusion of DIN at the lake sediment-water interface exhibited a strongly positive relationship with temperature, suggesting that high temperature conditions lead to greater DIN release from sediments. Cold temperatures cause DIN accumulation in sedimentary pore water, providing sufficient substrate for N-related bacteria in the sediment under cold temperature conditions. Temperature controls the vertical distribution of DIN by affecting its migratory diffusion and transformation at the sediment-water interface. These findings are valuable for understanding the impact of climate change on the distribution of N in inland shallow lakes, especially in high latitude shallow lakes subjected to large seasonal temperature differences throughout the year.

However, the principle of choosing water sources for water transfer projects has mainly been based on the effects on water quality, which neglects the influence in the variation of phytoplankton community and the risk of al-gal blooms. In this study, algal growth potential (AGP) test was applied to predict changes in the phytoplankton community caused by water transfer projects. The feasibility of proposed water transfer sources (Baqing River and Jinsha River) was assessed through the changes in both water quality and phytoplankton community in Chenghai Lake, Southwest China. The results showed that the concentration of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) in Chenghai Lake could be decreased to 0.52 mg/L and 0.02 mg/L respectively with the simulated water transfer source of Jinsha River. The algal cell density could be reduced by 60%, and the phytoplankton community would become relatively stable with the Jinsha River water transfer project, and the dominant species of Anabaena cylindrica evolved into An-abaenopsis arnoldii due to the species competition. However, the risk of algal blooms would be increased after the Baqing River water transfer project even with the improved water quality. Algae gained faster proliferation with the same dominant species in water transfer source. Therefore, water transfer projects should be assessed from not only the variation of water quality but also the risk of algal blooms.

This study applied a multimedia model (BETR model) to explore alternations in the spatio-temporal trends of concentrations and transport flux of benzopyrene (BaP), phenanthrene (Phe), perfluorooctane sulfonates (PFOS) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the Chaohu watershed, located in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, China in response to changes in source emissions and climate. The potential historic and future risks of these pollutants also were assessed. The results suggest that current trends in concentrations and transport were similar to that of their emissions between 2005 and 2018. During the next 100 years, temporal trends and spatial patterns were not predicted to change significantly, which is consistent with climate change. Based on sensitivity and correlation analyses, climate change had significant effects on multi-media concentrations and transport fluxes of BaP, Phe, PFOS and PCBs, and rainfall intensity was the predominant controlling factor. Risk quotients (RQs) of BaP and Phe-in soil increased from 0.42 to 0.95 and 0.06 to 0.35, respectively, from 2005 to 2090, indicating potential risks. The RQs of the other examined contaminants exhibited little potential risk in soil, water, or sediment. Based on spatial patterns, it was inferred that the ecosystem around Lake Chaohu is the most at risk. The study provides insights needed for local pollution control of POPs in the Chaohu watershed. In addition, the developed approach can be applied to other watersheds world-wide. (c) 2021 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In this study, a comprehensive study on PM25 and its chemical composition were performed in Yuncheng (the most polluted city of Fen-Wei Plain of China) from November 28, 2020 to January 24, 2021. The average concentration of PM25 was 87.8 +/- 52.0 mu g/m(3), which were apparently lower than those observed during the same periods of past five years, attributable to the clean air action plan implemented in this region. NO3- and organic carbon (OC) were the dominant particulate components, which on average contributed 22.6% and 16.5% to PM25, respectively. The fractions of NO3-, NH4+, OC and trace metals increased while those of crustal materials and elemental carbon decreased with the degradation of PM25 pollution. Six types of PM25 sources were identified by the PMF model, including secondary inorganic aerosol (35.3%), coal combustion (28.7%), vehicular emission (20.7%), electroplating industry (8.6%), smelt industry (3.9%) and dust (2.8%). Locations of each identified source were pinpointed based on conditional probability function, potential source contribution function and concentration weighted trajectory, which showed that the geographical distribution of the sources of PM2.5 roughly agreed with the areas of high emission. Overall, this study provides valuable information on atmospheric pollution and deems beneficial for policymakers to take informed action to sustainably improve air quality in highly polluted region.

During the pre-lockdown observational period (IOP-1), both Delta CO2 and Delta CH4 exhibited a significant increasing trend relative to the 2011-2019 climatological mean. The reduction of Delta CO2, Delta CH4 and Delta CO during the lockdown observational period (IOP-2) (which also coincided with the Chinese New Year Holiday) reached up to 15.0 ppm, 14.2 ppb and 146.8 ppb, respectively, and a reduction of Delta CO2/Delta CO probably due to a dramatic reduction from industrial emissions. Delta CO2, Delta CH4 and Delta CO were observed to keep declining during the post-lockdown easing phase (IOP-3), which is the synthetic result of lower than normal CO2 emissions from rural regions around LAN coupled with strong uptake of the terrestrial ecosystem. Interestingly, the trend reversed to gradual increase for all species during the later easing phase (IOP-4), with Delta CO2/Delta CO constantly increasing from IOP-2 to IOP-3 and finally IOP-4, consistent with recovery in industrial emissions associated with the staged resumption of economic activity. On average, Delta CO2 declined sharply throughout the days during IOP-2 but increased gradually throughout the days during IOP-4. The findings showcase the significant role of emission reduction in accounting for the dramatic changes in measured atmospheric Delta CO2 and Delta CH4 associated with the COVID-19 lockdown and recovery.

In this study, molecular characterization of WIOCs in PM 2.5 were investigated by 15 T Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) with atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI) source in positive ion mode. A total of 2573 and 1875 molecular formulas were identified in WIOCs extracted by dichloromethane, which were collected in hazy and normal days, respectively. The identified molecular formulas were further classified into four major subgroups, including CH, CHN, CHO and CHNO compounds. CHO compounds predominated in WIOCs, accounting for more than 60% in both samples. CHNO compounds (26.6%) and CH compounds (16.1%) were the second highest subgroups in WIOCs from the hazy days and normal days, respectively. The relative abundance and number of nitro-substituted aromatic compounds were significantly higher in hazy days than in normal days. The molecular composition of WIOCs was more complex in hazy days while more aromatic compounds were identified in normal days.

The potential contributions of ultrafine particles to the atmospheric optical characteristics and to haze spreading cannot be ignored because of their high particle number concentrations and strong diffusibility; measurement of the optical properties of wet ultrafine particles is thus highly important for environmental assessment. Therefore, a surface plasmon resonance microscopy with azimuthal rotation illumination (SPRM-ARI) system is designed to determine the RIs of single particle aerosols with diameters of less than 100 nm in the hygroscopic growth process. Measurements are taken using mixed single particles with different mass ratios. The RIs of mixed single aerosols at different RHs are retrieved by measuring the scattering light intensity using the SPRM-ARI system and almost all the RIs of the bicomponent particles with different mass ratios decrease with increasing water content under high RH conditions. Finally, for each of the bicomponent particles, the maximum standard deviations for the retrieved RI values are only 2.06 x 10(-3), 3.08 x 10(-3) and 3.83 x 10(-3), corresponding to the NaCl and NaNO3 bicomponent particles with a 3:1 mass ratio at 76.0% RH, the NaCl and glucose particles with a 1:3 mass ratio at 89.0% RH, and the NaC1 and OA particles with a 1:1 mass ratio at 78.0% RH, respectively; these results indicate that the high-sensitivity SPRM-ARI system can measure the RI effectively and accurately.

How-ever, the intrinsic reason for the elevation of the regional O-3 is still unclear. In this study, we analyzed the spatio-temporal variations of tropospheric O-3 and relevant pollutants (PM2.5, NO2, and CO) in the BTH region based on monitoring data from the China Ministry of Ecology and Environment during the period of 2014-2019. The results showed that summertime O-3 concentrations were constant in Beijing (BJ, 0.06 pg/(m(3).year)) but increased significantly in Tianjin (TJ, 9.09 pg/(m(3).year)) and Hebei (HB, 6.06 pg/(m(3).year)). Distinct O-3 trends between Beijing and other cities in BTH could not be attributed to the significant decrease in PM2.5 (from-5.08 to-6.32 pg/(m(3).year)) and CO (from-0.053 to-0.090 mg/(m(3).year)) because their decreasing rates were approximately the same in all the cities. The relatively stable O-3 con-centrations during the investigating period in BJ may be attributed to a faster decreasing rate of NO2 (BJ:-2.55 pg/(m(3).year); TJ:-1.16 pg/(m(3).year); HB:-1.34 pg/(m(3).year)), indicating that the continued reduction of NOx will be an effective mitigation strategy for reducing regional O-3 pollution. Significant positive correlations were found between daily maximum 8 hr average (MDA8) O-3 concentrations and vehicle population and highway freight trans-portation in HB. Therefore, we speculate that the increase in rural NOx emissions due to the increase in vehicle emissions in the vast rural areas around HB greatly accelerates regional O-3 frmation, accounting for the significant increasing trends of O-3 in HB.

In this study, we primarily analyze the seasonal to sub-seasonal variations of the ATAL and the factors potentially influencing those variations based on MERRA2 reanalysis. The ability of the reanalysis to reproduce the ATAL is well validated by CALIPSO observations from May to October 2016. The results reveal that the ATAL has a synchronous spatiotemporal pattern with the development and movement of the Asian Summer Monsoon. Significant enhancement of ATAL intensity is found during the prevailing monsoon period of July-August, with two maxima centered over South Asia and the Arabian Peninsula. Owing to the fluctuations of deep convection, the ATAL shows an episodic variation on a timescale of 7-12 days. Attribution analysis indicates that deep convection dominates the variability of the ATAL with a contribution of 62.7%, followed by a contribution of 36.6% from surface pollutants. The impact of precipitation is limited. The ATAL further shows a clear diurnal variation: the peak of ATAL intensity occurs from 17:30 to 23:30 local time (LT), when the deep convection becomes strongest; the minimum ATAL intensity occurs around 8:30 LT owing to the weakened deep convection and photochemical reactions in clouds. The aerosol components of the ATAL show different spatiotemporal patterns and imply that black carbon and organic carbon come mainly from India, whereas sulfate comes mainly from China during the prevailing monsoon period.

In this study, we used a High-Resolution Time-of-Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) and Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS) to characterize the composition of submicron particles. Moreover, we applied the ISORROPIA-II model to analyze the particle acidity effect on the compositional characterization of submicron particles from December 22, 2016 to January 7, 2017 in Albany, New York, USA. The results indicated that aerosols with mobility diameter from SMPS in the range 200-400 nm were the main contributors to the mass during the measurement period. The dominance of organics (47%) and sulfate (16%) was similar to previous observations in the eastern United States in Winter 2015, while the fraction of nitrate (23%) was much higher. Moreover, nitrate could easily form at colder temperatures and lower RH levels even when there were more acidic particle periods during the measurement period in Albany. The ISORROPIA-II model indicated that there were more acidic particles, which was estimated using pH values. Lower temperature conditions tended to favor nitrate formation. The nitrate concentration exceeded that of sulfate in the measurement period, even though the SO2 and NOx emissions were similar. The organics in submicron particles were strongly influenced by the local emissions in winter. However, the inorganic compounds in submicron particles could be derived from regional transport as their pollution sources originated from different directions. This may help strategize emission reductions in the future. (C) 2021 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Association of retreating monsoon and extreme air pollution in a megacity	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Monsoon; Air pollution; Climatology; WRF-Chem; Extreme events; PM2.5	EMISSIONS; AEROSOLS; EVENTS; DELHI	The world's top ranked mega city Delhi is known for deteriorated air quality. However, the analysis of air pollution data of 5 years (2014-2018) reveals that years 2016 and 2017, which were marked by an unusual delayed withdrawal of monsoon, witnessed an unprecedented extreme levels of toxic PM2.5 particles (<= 2.5 mu m in diameter) touching a peak level of similar to 760 mu g/m(3) (24 hr average), immediately after the monsoon retreat, surpassing WHO standards by similar to 30 time and Indian national standards by similar to 12 times, jeopardising lives of its citizens. However, the normal monsoon withdrawal years do not show such extreme levels of pollution. The high resolution WRF-Chem model along with meteorological data are used in this work to understand that how the delayed monsoon withdrawal and associated vagarious anti-cyclonic circulation resulted in trapping externally generated pollutants ceaselessly under colder conditions, leading to historic air quality crisis in landlocked mega city in these selected years. The sensitivity analysis confirmed that when WRF-chem model forced the climatology of normal monsoon year (2015) to simulate the pollution scenario of 2016 and 2017 for the above time period, the crisis subsided. Present findings suggest that such unusual monsoon patterns are on the hook to spur extreme pollution events in recent time.

Nevertheless, current energy policies are unlikely to achieve the climate goal without sacrificing economic development and people's livelihood because fossil fuels are currently the dominant energy source. As an environment-friendly manufacturing technology, three-dimensional printing (3DP) is flourishing and is considered beneficial to energy structure adjustment and industrial upgrading. Despite this, its poten-tial to contribute to global carbon neutrality has not attracted enough attention. Herein, we explore the application of 3DP and its potential facilitating carbon neutrality from cru-cial sectors and applications including manufacturing, construction energy, livestock, and carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. The additive manufacturing and decentral-ized manufacturing characteristics of 3DP allow reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in manufacturing and construction sectors by optimized and lightweight designs, reduced material and energy consumption, and shortened transport processes. In addition, 3DP en-ables the precise manufacturing of customized complex structures and the expansion of functional materials, which makes 3DP an innovative alternative to the development of novel energy-related devices, cultured meat production technology, and CCS technologies. Despite this, the majority of applications of 3DP are still in an early stage and need further exploration. We call for further research to precisely evaluate the GHG emission reduction potential of 3DP and to make it better involved and deployed to better achieve carbon neu-trality.(c) 2022 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

J	Wen, Y; Zhang, WG; Shan, BG				Wen, Yan; Zhang, Wengiang; Shan, Baoging			Amino acids as indicators of seasonal variations in organic matter degradation in surface sediments from a shallow lake	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Sediment; Organic matter; Amino acid; Temperature; Degradation	TEMPERATURE; CHINA; MINERALIZATION; KINETICS	Degradation of organic matter (OM) in sediments is a key link in nutrient cycling and sedimentation processes in lakes. The aim of this study was to explore the degradation of OM in surface sediments of a shallow lake (Baiyangdian Lake, China) under seasonal temperature variations. For this, we used the amino acid-based degradation index (DI) and the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics and sources of OM. Sediment OM in the lake mainly originated from freshwater aquatic plants and terrestrial C4 plants. The sediment at some sampling sites was affected by surrounding crops. The organic carbon and total nitrogen contents, and the total hydrolyzed amino acid concentrations in the sediments were highest in summer and lowest in winter. The lowest DI occurred in spring, which indicated that the OM in the surface sediment at this time was highly degraded and relatively stable, and the highest DI occurred in winter, which showed that the sediment was fresh. The water temperature was positively correlated with the organic carbon content ( p < 0.01) and total hydrolyzed amino acids concentration ( p < 0.05). Seasonal variations in the overlying water temperature had a large effect on OM degradation in the lake sediments.
