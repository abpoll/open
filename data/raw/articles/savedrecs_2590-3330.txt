Global decline in capacity of coral reefs to provide ecosystem services	ONE EARTH			English	Article							MARINE PROTECTED AREAS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FISHERIES; DRIVEN; CONSERVATION; EXPANSION; IMPACTS; FISH	Coral reefs worldwide are facing impacts from climate change, overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. The cumulative effect of these impacts on global capacity of coral reefs to provide ecosystem services is unknown. Here, we evaluate global changes in extent of coral reef habitat, coral reef fishery catches and effort, Indigenous consumption of coral reef fishes, and coral-reef-associated biodiversity. Global coverage of living coral has declined by half since the 1950s. Catches of coral-reef-associated fishes peaked in 2002 and are in decline despite increasing fishing effort, and catch-per-unit effort has decreased by 60% since 1950. At least 63% of coral-reef-associated biodiversity has declined with loss of coral extent. With projected continued degradation of coral reefs and associated loss of biodiversity and fisheries catches, the well-being and sustainable coastal development of human communities that depend on coral reef ecosystem services are threatened.

J	Supran, G; Oreskes, N				Supran, Geoffrey; Oreskes, Naomi			Rhetoric and frame analysis of ExxonMobil's climate change communications	ONE EARTH			English	Article							OP-ED PAGE; FOSSIL-FUEL; MARKETPLACE ADVOCACY; INDUSTRY ACTORS; SOCIAL-PROBLEM; MOBIL-OIL; TOBACCO; POLICY; HISTORY; ENERGY	This paper investigates how ExxonMobil uses rhetoric and framing to shape public discourse on climate change. We present an algorithmic corpus comparison and machine-learning topic model of 180 ExxonMobil climate change communications, including peer-reviewed publications, internal company documents, and advertorials in The New York Times. We also investigate advertorials using inductive frame analysis. We find that the company has publicly overemphasized some terms and topics while avoiding others. Most notably, they have used rhetoric of climate "risk" and consumer energy "demand" to construct a "Fossil Fuel Savior" (FFS) frame that downplays the reality and seriousness of climate change, normalizes fossil fuel lock-in, and individualizes responsibility. These patterns mimic the tobacco industry's documented strategy of shifting responsibility away from corporations-which knowingly sold a deadly product while denying its harms-and onto consumers. This historical parallel foreshadows the fossil fuel industry's use of demand-as-blame arguments to oppose litigation, regulation, and activism.

Given cities' heterogeneity, they need specific low-carbon roadmaps instead of one-size-fits-all approaches. Here, we present the most detailed and up-to-date accounts of CO2 emissions for 294 cities in China and examine the extent to which their economic growth was decoupled from emissions. Results show that from 2005 to 2015, only 11% of cities exhibited strong decoupling, whereas 65.6% showed weak decoupling, and 23.4% showed no decoupling. We attribute the economic-emission decoupling in cities to several socioeconomic factors (i.e., structure and size of the economy, emission intensity, and population size) and find that the decline in emission intensity via improvement in production and carbon efficiency (e.g., decarbonizing the energy mix via building a renewable energy system) is the most important one. The experience and status quo of carbon emissions and emission-GDP (gross domestic product) decoupling in Chinese cities may have implications for other developing economies to design low-carbon development pathways.

Nature-based solutions (NbS) are gaining traction in science and policy, but their potential for transformative change remains unexplored. We provide a framework to evaluate how NbS contribute to transformative change and apply it to 93 NbS from mountain social-ecological systems (SES). The framework serves to assess what elements may catalyze transformative change, how transformative change occurs, and what its outcomes are. Our results show that NbS are as much "people based'' as "nature based.'' Most NbS are based on four elements with transformation poten-tial: nature's values, knowledge types, community engagement, and nature management practices. Our results confirm the potential of NbS for transformative change, observed through changes in non-sustainable trajectories of SES. We illustrate the components of our framework through a novel classification of NbS. The framework provides key components for assessing the effectiveness of NbS and allows tracking long-term transformative change processes.

Carla			Historical and future global burned area with changing climate and human demography	ONE EARTH			English	Article							WILDLAND-URBAN INTERFACE; PLANT GEOGRAPHY; RECENT TRENDS; FIRE REGIMES; VEGETATION; IMPACTS; MODEL; EARTH; SCENARIOS; EXPANSION	Wildfires influence terrestrial carbon cycling and represent a safety risk, and yet a process-based understanding of their frequency and spatial distributions remains elusive. We combine satellite-based observations with an enhanced dynamic global vegetation model to make regionally resolved global assessments of burned area (BA) responses to changing climate, derived from 34 Earth system models and human demographics for 1860-2100. Limited by climate and socioeconomics, recent BA has decreased, especially in central South America and mesic African savannas. However, future simulations predict increasing BA due to changing climate, rapid population density growth, and urbanization. BA increases are especially notable at high latitudes, due to accelerated warming, and over the tropics and subtropics, due to drying and human ignitions. Conversely, rapid urbanization also limits BA via enhanced fire suppression in the immediate vicinity of settlements, offsetting the potential for dramatic future increases, depending on warming extent. Our analysis provides further insight into regional and global BA trends, highlighting the importance of including human demographic change in models for wildfire under changing climate.

Although it is widely accepted that climate change perturbs these conditions, no systematic understanding exists on where and how the major risks for entering unprecedented conditions may occur. Here, we address this gap by introducing the concept of safe climatic space (SCS), which incorporates the decisive climatic factors of agricultural production: precipitation, temperature, and aridity. We show that a rapid and unhalted growth of greenhouse gas emissions (SSP5-8.5) could force 31% of the global food crop and 34% of livestock production beyond the SCS by 2081-2100. The most vulnerable areas are South and Southeast Asia and Africa's Sudano-Sahelian Zone, which have low resilience to cope with these changes. Our results underpin the importance of committing to a low-emissions scenario (SSP1-2.6), whereupon the extent of food production facing unprecedented conditions would be a fraction.

Trees are utilized to adapt to urban heat; however, most tree planting is prioritized by either biophysical or social metrics, rather than an integration of the two. It therefore remains unclear how to maximize ecological and social benefits of tree planting in the context of environmental justice. Here, we analyze social vulnerability to heat and the cooling capacity of trees across 38 of the largest cities in the United States. We find that socially vulnerable people tend to live in hotter neighborhoods with less tree canopy. Furthermore, tree planting in such neighborhoods can achieve greater cooling benefits per unit increase in canopy. Increasing tree cover in these neighborhoods will meet the greatest need for cooling and achieve greater cooling capacity, creating social and ecological co-benefits. Adaptation measures must address both the distributional injustices of urban heat and procedural justice in planning and managing nature-based cooling approaches.

Yet, large-scale trends in tree mortality and their effects on forest demography remain poorly quantified despite the important role of forest demography for forest carbon pools and biodiversity. Analyzing satellite data at 19,896 plots, we here show that canopy mortality in 35 European countries increased from 1985 to 2018 (+1.5% +/- 0.28% yr(-1)). Using simulations, we demonstrate that recent levels of canopy mortality will halt the aging trend of Europe's forests and that a further increase in canopy mortality has the potential to strongly alter Europe's forest demography toward younger forests. These demographic changes will have cascading negative effects on forest biodiversity and carbon storage. Developing strategies to address the increasing canopy mortality should thus be a key priority of forest policy and management in Europe.

However, the interactive effects of e[O-3] and e[CO2] on these functions and services remain unclear. Here, we synthesize the results of 810 studies (9,109 observations), spanning boreal to tropical regions around the world, and show that e[O-3] significantly decreases global net primary productivity and food production as well as the capacity of ecosystems to store carbon and nitrogen, which are stimulated by e[CO2]. More importantly, simultaneous increases in [CO2] and [O-3] negate or even overcompensate the negative effects of e[O-3] on ecosystem functions and carbon and nitrogen cycles. Therefore, the negative effects of e[O-3] on terrestrial ecosystems would be overestimated if e[CO2] impacts are not considered, stressing the need for evaluating terrestrial carbon and nitrogen feedbacks to concurrent changes in global atmospheric composition.

Detecting vulnerability of humid tropical forests to multiple stressors	ONE EARTH			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; RAIN-FORESTS; LAND-USE; AMAZON; RESILIENCE; DROUGHT; CARBON; SENSITIVITY; AFRICAN; ERRORS	Humid tropical forests play a dominant role in the functioning of Earth but are under increasing threat from changes in land use and climate. How forest vulnerability varies across space and time and what level of stress forests can tolerate before facing a tipping point are poorly understood. Here, we develop a tropical forest vulnerability index (TFVI) to detect and evaluate the vulnerability of global tropical forests to threats across space and time. We show that climate change together with land-use change have slowed the recovery rate of forest carbon cycling. Temporal autocorrelation, as an indicator of this slow recovery, increases substantially for above-ground biomass, gross primary production, and evapotranspiration when climate stress reaches a critical level. Forests in the Americas exhibit extensive vulnerability to these stressors, while in Africa, forests show relative resilience to climate, and in Asia reveal more vulnerability to land use and fragmentation. TFVI can systematically track the response of tropical forests to multiple stressors and provide early-warning signals for regions undergoing critical transitions.

Full-volatility emission framework corrects missing and underestimated secondary organic aerosol sources	ONE EARTH			English	Article							AIR-POLLUTANT EMISSIONS; INTERMEDIATE-VOLATILITY; REGIONAL TRANSPORT; COMPOUND EMISSIONS; COMBUSTION SOURCES; COAL COMBUSTION; RIVER DELTA; PART 3; SEMIVOLATILE; PM2.5	Organic aerosol (OA) is the largest and most complicated component of aerosols that greatly affect human health and global climate. However, widely used models cannot reproduce primary and secondary OA concentrations, and thus the source contributions of OA remain elusive. This is largely caused by the oversimplification of traditional organic emission inventories. Here, we develop an emission framework that achieves a full volatility coverage in both the gas and particle phases with a high chemical and volatility resolution. The new inventory fills a gap of 3,382 kt/y semi-and intermediate-volatility organic emissions and 59% ambient secondary OA (SOA) concentrations in China 2017, resulting in a significantly improved model-measurement agreement. Volatile chemical products, domestic combustion, and biomass open burning, with their SOA contributions increased by a factor of two to nine, turn out to be three leading sources of SOA. Future control policies must focus more on these previously underestimated sources.

Alternative-energy-vehicles deployment delivers climate, air quality, and health co-benefits when coupled with decarbonizing power generation in China	ONE EARTH			English	Article							HYDROGEN FUEL-CELL; NATURAL-GAS; STATISTICAL LIFE; SOCIAL COST; LARGE-SCALE; EMISSIONS; IMPACTS; ELECTRIFICATION; MITIGATION; SYSTEM	China is the world's largest carbon emitter and suffers from severe air pollution, which results in approximately one million premature deaths/year. Alternative energy vehicles (AEVs) (electric, hydrogen fuel cell, and natural gas vehicles) can reduce carbon emissions and improve air quality. However, climate, air quality, and health benefits of AEVs powered with deeply decarbonized power generation are poorly quantified. Here, we quantitatively estimate the air quality, health, carbon emission, and economic benefits of replacing internal combustion engine vehicles with various AEVs. We find co-benefits increase dramatically as the electricity grid decarbonizes and hydrogen is produced from non-fossil fuels. Relative to 2015, a conversion to AEVs using largely non-fossil power can reduce air pollution and associated premature mortalities and years of life lost by similar to 329,000 persons/year and similar to 1,611,000 life years/year. Thus, maximizing climate, air quality, and health benefits of AEV deployment in China requires rapid decarbonization of the power system.

Support for this transition is often dampened by the impact on fossil fuel jobs. Previous work shows that pro-climate polices could increase employment by 20 million net energy jobs, but these studies rely on Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) jobs data, assumptions about jobs in non OECD countries, and a single baseline assumption. Here we combine a global dataset of job intensities across 11 energy technologies and five job categories in 50 countries with an integrated assessment model under three shared socioeconomic pathways. We estimate direct energy jobs under a WB2C scenario and current policy scenarios. We find that, by 2050, energy sector jobs would grow from today's 18 million to 26 million under a WB2C scenario compared with 21 million under the current policy scenario. Fossil fuel extraction jobs would rapidly decline, but losses will be compensated by gains in solar and wind jobs, particularly in the manufacturing sector (totaling 7.7 million in 2050).

Consequently, China has deployed a series of control measures to mitigate fine particulate matter (PM2.5). However, the extent to which these measures have been effective is obscured by the existence of confounding meteorological effects. Here, we use a newly developed reduced-form model that can address emission-driven PM2.5 trends and control for meteorological effects to examine the level of PM2.5 reduction across 367 cities since the introduction of the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan (the Plan) in 2013. Our findings show that, on average, the national annual mean level of PM2.5 decreased by 34% from 2013 to 2019 after the removal of meteorological effects, about 10% less than the reduction level officially observed. Despite this difference, assuming that current control efforts continue through 2035, the long-term air-quality target of 35 mg/m(3) as determined by the recently updated Plan will be met.

Yet individual decisions to migrate involve multiple motivations including perceived environmental risks and economic opportunities. We analyze how perceptions of environmental risks affect migration decisions and future migration intentions. We use cross-sectional household survey data (N = 5,450) from populations engaged in migration in net out-migration areas in four coastal areas in Ghana, Bangladesh, and India to examine ex post-migration motivations and ex ante-future migration intentions. The data include variables on previous migration, migration intentions, well-being, food insecurity, and perceived long-term environmental degradation. The results show that few households identified environmental risks as the primary driver for past migration decisions. Perceived increased severity of drought and household insecurity both reduce stated future migration intentions. Hence, perceptions of environmental risks, including future potential changes, are significant in altering aggregate migration flows from source areas in low-lying coastal regions.

Here we identify 147 historical episodes and policy pledges of fossil fuel decline in 105 countries and global regions between 1960 and 2018. We analyze 43 cases in larger systems most rele-vant to climate scenarios. One-half of 1.5 degrees C-compatible scenarios envision coal decline in Asia faster than in any of these cases. The remaining scenarios as well as many scenarios for coal and gas decline in other regions have precedents only where oil was replaced by coal, gas, or nuclear power in response to energy security threats. Achieving the 1.5 degrees C target will be difficult in the absence of fossil fuel decline mechanisms that extend far beyond historical experience or current pledges.

Concurrently, the prevalence of insufficient sleep is rising in many populations. Yet it remains unclear whether warmer-than average temperatures causally impact objective measures of sleep globally. Here, we link billions of repeated sleep measurements from sleep-tracking wristbands comprising over 7 million sleep records (n = 47,628) across 68 countries to local daily meteorological data. Controlling for individual, seasonal, and time varying confounds, increased temperature shortens sleep primarily through delayed onset, increasing the probability of insufficient sleep. The temperature effect on sleep loss is substantially larger for residents from lower-income countries and older adults, and females are affected more than males. Those in hotter regions experience comparably more sleep loss per degree of warming, suggesting limited adaptation. By 2099, suboptimal temperatures may erode 50-58 h of sleep per person-year, with climate change producing geographic inequalities that scale with future emissions.

Exploring the future of fishery conflict through narrative scenarios	ONE EARTH			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; OCEAN; MANAGEMENT; GOVERNANCE; FORESIGHT; SECURITY; SYSTEMS; MODELS	Recent studies suggest that the pervasive impacts on global fishery resources caused by stressors such as overfishing and climate change could dramatically increase the likelihood of fishery conflict. However, existing projections do not consider wider economic, social, or political trends when assessing the likelihood of, and influences on, future conflict trajectories. In this paper, we build four future fishery conflict scenarios by considering multiple fishery conflict drivers derived from an expert workshop, a longitudinal database of international fishery conflict, secondary data on conflict driver trends, and regional expert reviews. The scenarios take place between the years 2030 and 2060 in the North-East Atlantic ("scramble for the Atlantic''), the East China Sea ("the remodeled empire''), the coast of West Africa ("oceanic decolonization''), and the Arctic ("polar renaissance''). The scenarios explore the implications of ongoing trends in conflict-prone regions of the world and function as accessible, science-based communication tools that can help foster anticipatory governance capacity in the pursuit of future ocean security.

Here, we consider high-stakes investments across the water, energy, and food sectors for two major river basins in a climate transition zone in Africa. We integrate detailed interpretation of observed and modeled climate-system behavior with hydrological modeling and decision-relevant performance metrics. For the Rufiji River in Tanzania, projected risks for the mid-21st century are similar to those of the present day, but for the Lake Malawi-Shire River, future risk exceeds that experienced during the 20th century. In both basins a repeat of an early-20th century multi-year drought would challenge the viability of proposed infrastructure. A long view, which emphasizes past and future changes in variability, set within a broader context of climate-information interpretation and decision making, is crucial for screening the risk to infrastructure.

J	Fesenfeld, LP; Rinscheid, A				Fesenfeld, Lukas Paul; Rinscheid, Adrian			Emphasizing urgency of climate change is insufficient to increase policy support	ONE EARTH			English	Article							CONSTRUAL-LEVEL THEORY; PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTANCE; LONG-TERM; FUTURE; RISK; PERCEPTIONS; TIME; ENGAGEMENT; EXPERIENCE; PROXIMITY	Although many people are concerned about climate change, active public support for ambitious policies is still lagging behind. How can this gap be closed? Recent work has theorized that the perceived urgency of climate change drives public support for climate policy, but this lacks empirical evidence. Using advanced sparse regressions and comparative survey-embedded framing experiments with 9,911 eligible voters in Germany and the United States, we empirically studied the role of perceived urgency. Our study provides two findings. First, although perceived urgency is key in driving support for "low-cost'' mitigation policies, it does not lead to more support for "high-cost'' mitigation policies where the behavioral implications are visible. Second, while temporal reframing does not increase policy support or feelings of dread, context information about demand-side mitigation increases support for such costly climate policies. The results are particularly relevant for democracies, where ambitious policies require the support of citizens.

Atmospheric brown carbon (BrC) is one of the least understood and uncertain warming agents due to a scarcity of observations. Here, we performed direct observations of atmospheric BrC and quantified its light-absorbing properties during a 2 month circum-Arctic cruise in summer of 2017. Through observation-constrained modeling, we show that BrC, mainly originated from biomass burning in the mid-to high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere (similar to 60%), can be a strong warming agent in the Arctic region, especially in the summer, with an average radiative forcing of-90 mW m(-2) (similar to 30% relative to black carbon). As climate change is projected to increase the frequency, intensity, and spread of wildfires, we expect BrC to play an increasing role in Arctic warming in the future.

Climate-induced increases in micronutrient availability for coral reef fisheries	ONE EARTH			English	Article							REGIME SHIFTS; FOOD SECURITY; FISH; MESOPREDATORS; CHAINS	Climate change is transforming coral reefs, threatening supply of essential dietary micronutrients from smallscale fisheries to tropical coastal communities. Yet the nutritional value of reef fisheries and climate impacts on micronutrient availability remain unclear, hindering efforts to sustain food and nutrition security. Here, we measure nutrient content in coral reef fishes in Seychelles and show that reef fish are important sources of selenium and zinc and contain levels of calcium, iron, and omega-3 fatty acids comparable with other animal-source foods. Using experimental fishing, we demonstrate that iron and zinc are enriched in fishes caught on regime-shifted macroalgal habitats, whereas selenium and omega-3 varied among species. We find substantial increases in nutrients available to fisheries over two decades following coral bleaching, particularly for iron and zinc after macroalgal regime shifts. Our findings indicate that, if managed sustainably, coral reef fisheries could remain important micronutrient sources along tropical coastlines despite escalating climate impacts.	[Robinson, James P.

A variety of different technologies could contribute to this transition, and uncertainty remains over their relative role and value. A growing school of thought argues that rapid cost reductions in renewables reduce the need for carbon capture and storage (CCS) in mitigation pathways. Here we use an integrated assessment model to explore how the value of CCS is affected by cost reductions in solar photovoltaics, onshore, and offshore wind. Low-cost renewables could erode the value of CCS by 15%-96% across different energy sectors. Renewables directly compete with CCS, accelerate power sector decarbonization, and enable greater electrification of end-use sectors. CCS has greatest value and resilience to low-cost renewables in sustainable bioenergy/industrial applications, with limited value in hydrogen/electricity generation. This suggests that targeted, rather than blanket, CCS deployment represents the best strategy for achieving the Paris Agreement goals.

The complexity of causation, as well as the myriad ways thatan event, or a sequence of events, creates cascading and systemic impacts, poses significant challenges tofood systems research and policy alike. To identify priority food security risks and research opportunities, weasked experts from a range of fields and geographies to describe key threats to global food security over thenext two decades and to suggest key research questions and gaps on this topic. Here, we present a priori-tization of threats to global food security from extreme events, as well as emerging research questions thathighlight the conceptual and practical challenges that exist in designing, adopting, and governing resilientfood systems. We hope that these findings help in directing research funding and resources toward food sys-tem transformations needed to help society tackle major food system risks and food insecurity underextreme events.

Energy system decarbonization and productivity gains reduced the coupling of CO2 emissions and economic growth in 73 countries between 1970 and 2016	ONE EARTH			English	Article							CARBON-DIOXIDE EMISSIONS; ENVIRONMENTAL KUZNETS CURVE; WORLD; TEMPERATURE; POLLUTION; STIRPAT; IMPACT; TRADE; PATH; BAD	Nations must curtail carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 7% per annum to meet the Paris Agreement temperature targets. A perceived economic growth-climate mitigation trade-off has diminished political will to act. However, there is no scholarly consensus regarding the magnitude of the trade-off between economic growth and CO2 mitigation and a lack of ex post evidence regarding the extent to which mitigation measures can effectively lower CO2 emissions. Here, we present a structural equation model integrating emissions and economic and energy system characteristics over the period 1970-2016 to empirically assess mechanisms that influence the GDP-CO2 relationship for 73 countries. Robust to various model specifications and statistical tests, we found a simple unitary scale effect between per capita GDP and per capita CO2 emissions, while five emission-reduction mechanisms, principally energy system decarbonization and productivity gains, collectively contributed to global emission reductions by 19 petagrams. Within the observed yearto-year emissions development, reductions at a rate consistent with the Paris Agreement can be achieved in about 10% of instances while maintaining economic growth.

The government has implemented measures to replace coal with relatively clean energy sources (e.g., natural gas). However, the scale and scope of health benefits associated with such energy switching in an urban context, when considering both ambient and indoor air quality, remain unclear. Here we used an atmospheric chemical transport model showing that relatively clean energy use increased from 2% to 71% from 1980 to 2014, and although annual premature deaths attributed to particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 mm (PM2.5) from urban residential sources increased from 136,000 (87,000-194,000) to 202,000 (117,000-302,000) during the same period, this was primarily due to population growth, urbanization, aging, and backgroundmortality rate changes. In the absence of energy switching, there would have been 2.2 million additional premature deaths. The results provide solid evidence on health benefits of energy switching, suggesting further switching to cleaner energy for expanded health-climate co-benefits.

Sea-level rise enhances carbon accumulation in United States tidal wetlands	ONE EARTH			English	Article							MARSH EDGE EROSION; SALT-MARSH; ORGANIC-CARBON; TEMPERATURE SENSITIVITY; COASTAL WETLANDS; RATES; SEQUESTRATION; STORAGE; MODEL; STABILITY	Coastal wetlands accumulate soil carbon more efficiently than terrestrial systems, but sea-level rise potentially threatens the persistence of this prominent carbon sink. Here, we combine a published dataset of 372 soil carbon accumulation rates from across the United States with new analysis of 131 sites in coastal Louisiana and find that the rate of relative sea-level rise (RSLR) explains 80% of regional variation in carbon accumulation. A carbon mass balance for the rapidly submerging Louisiana coast demonstrates that carbon accumulation rates in surviving marshes increase with RSLR and currently exceed the rate of carbon loss due to marsh drowning and erosion. Although continued erosion will eventually lead to net carbon loss, our results suggest a strong negative carbon-climate feedback for coastal marshes, where even submerging marshes sequester carbon at rates that increase with RSLR.

Biomethane and biogas that use organic wastes as a feedstock have emerged as alternatives to natural gas, with lower carbon and methane emissions. However, the extent to which methane is still emitted at various stages along biogas and biomethane supply chains remains unclear. Here, we adopt a Monte Carlo approach to systematically synthesize the distribution of methane emissions at each key biomethane and biogas supply chain stage using data collected fromthe existing literature. We showthat the top 5% of emitters are responsible for 62% of emissions. Methane emissions could be more than two times of greater than previously estimated, with the digestate handling stage responsible for the majority of methane released. To ensure the climate benefits of biomethane and biogas production, effective methane-mitigation strategies must be designed and deployed at each supply chain stage.

Breaking down barriers: The identification of actions to promote gender equality in interdisciplinary marine research institutions	ONE EARTH			English	Article							KNOWLEDGE EXCHANGE; WOMEN; SCIENCE; FEMALE; DIVERSITY; CHALLENGES; ACADEMICS; MENTORS; CLIMATE; COLLABORATION	Interdisciplinary research is paramount to addressing ocean sustainability challenges in the 21st century. However, women leaders have been underrepresented in interdisciplinary marine research, and there is little guidance on how to achieve the conditions that will lead to an increased proportion of women scientists in positions of leadership. Here, we conduct in-depth qualitative research to explore the main barriers and enablers to women's leadership in an academic interdisciplinary marine research context. We found that interdisciplinarity can present unique and additional barriers to women leaders (e.g., complexity and lack of value attributed to interdisciplinary research) and are exacerbated by existing gender-specific issues that women experience (e.g., isolation and underrepresentation and stereotyping). Together these barriers overlap forming the "glass obstacle course''-which is particularly challenging for women in minoritized groups. Here, we provide a list of concrete, ambitious, and actionable enablers that can promote and support women's leadership in academic interdisciplinary marine research.

The government has deployed Three Red Lines (TRLs) to improve water security by 2030 and committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2060. China's industries, which account for half of national CO2 emissions and >20% water withdrawals, is key to decarbonization and water conservation. However, there remains a lack of consensus regarding whether industrial emission reduction and water saving can be achieved simultaneously. Here, we adopt a general equilibrium model using a self-developed high-resolution provincial water-use inventory based on enterprise census data, to uncover the impacts achieving carbon neutrality would have on industrial water use across China. Meeting carbon neutrality enables the achievement of the TRL-associated industrial water-use target and can reduce industrial water use by 24% in 2060. Nevertheless, if inter-provincial industrial relocation occurs, water use could rise in certain provinces, reducing the above water-saving potential. Stricter and coordinated policies and technological advancements are essential to successfully address climate and water challenges concurrently.
