In this 2-year long field study, microplastics were characterized and quantified in urban stormwater runoff and through a bioretention cell, a type of low impact development infrastructure. Concentrations of microparticles ranged from below the detection limit to 704 microparticles/L and the dominant morphology found were fibers. High rainfall intensity and longer antecedent dry days resulted in larger microparticle concentrations. In addition, atmospheric deposition was a source of microplastics to urban runoff. Overall, these results demonstrate that urban stormwater runoff is a concentrated source of microplastics whose concentrations depend on specific climate variables. The bioretention cell showed an 84% decrease in median microparticle concentration in the 106-5,0 0 0 mu m range, and thus is effective in filtering out microplastics and preventing their spread to downstream environments. Altogether, these results highlight the large contribution of urban stormwater runoff to microplastic contamination in larger aquatic systems and demonstrate the potential for current infiltration-based low impact development practices to limit the spread of microplastic contamination downstream.

However, a quantitative analysis about impacts of lake warming on the internal nutrient cycling in eutrophic lakes is limited. In this study, monthly nutrient monitoring data set in 2015-2016 in eutrophic Lake Chaohu, China, revealed a regular seasonal pattern of nutrient concentration. A process-based water quality model was established to quantify contributions from internal loadings on seasonal nutrient variations and predict responses under climate change scenarios. Results indicated that internal nutrient loading was responsible for the intra-annual variations of nutrient concentrations in the lake, and the internal loadings fluctuated much more between different seasons than the external nutrient inputs. We predicted that lake warming might probably result in stronger seasonal fluctuations of internal loading and create conditions beneficial for longer duration of cyanobacteria blooms in the year. Evidence derived from this study could help water managers to rethink the existing mitigation strategies in the restoration of eutrophic lakes and emphasize the potential interactions among lake warming, eutrophication and internal nutrient cycling in the future.

In literature, there is a lack of studies that can unfold the potential environmental and economic impacts of the transition that wastewater utilities are undertaking to transform their treatment plants to water resource recovery facilities (WRRFs). When existing, literature studies are mostly based on simulations rather than real plant data and pilot-scale results. This study combines life cycle assessment and economic evaluations to quantify the environmental and economic impacts of retrofitting an existing wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), which already implements energy recovery, into a full-scale WRRF with a series of novel technologies, the majority of which are already implemented full-scale or tested through pilot-scales. We evaluate five technology alternatives against the current performance of the WWTP: real-time N2O control, biological biogas upgrading coupled with power-to-hydrogen, phosphorus recovery, pre-filtration carbon harvest and enhanced nitrogen removal. Our results show that real-time N2O control, biological biogas upgrading and pre-filtration lead to a decrease in climate change and fossil resource depletion impacts. The implementation of the real-time measurement and control of N2O achieved the highest reduction in direct CO2eq emissions (-35%), with no significant impacts in other environmental categories. Biological biogas upgrading contributed to counterbalancing direct and indirect climate change impacts by substituting natural gas consumption and production. Pre-filtration increased climate change reduction by 13%, while it increased impacts in other categories. Enhanced sidestream nitrogen removal increased climate change impacts by 12%, but decreased marine eutrophication impacts by 14%. The reserve base resource depletion impacts, however, were the highest in the plant configurations implementing biological biogas upgrading coupled with power-to-hydrogen. Environmental improvements generated economic costs for all alternatives except for real-time N2O control. The results expose possible environmental and economic trade-offs and hotspots of the journey that large wastewater treatment plants will undertake in transitioning into resource recovery facilities in the coming years.

It showed sound organic removal over 86% with the permeate COD less than 50 mg/L even at extremely low temperatures below 10 degrees C. COD mass balance analysis revealed that membrane rejection (with a contribution rate of 10%-20%) guaranteed the stable organic removal, particularly at psychrophilic temperature. The methane yield was over 0.24 L CH4 (STP)/g COD (removed) at mesophilic temperature and 0.21 L CH4 (()(STP)())/8 COD removed at 5-15 degrees C. Pyrosequencing of microbial communities suggested that lower temperature reduced the abundance of the methane producing bacteria, but the methane production was enhanced by selectively enriched Methanosaeta, syntrophic Syntrophobacter and Smithella and exoelectrogenic Geobacter for direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) on the additive GAC. Compared with previously reported pilot-scale AnMBRs, the GAC-AnMBR in this study showed better overall performance and higher stability in a wide temperature range of 5-35 degrees C. The synergistic effect of GAC on AnMBR guaranteed the robustness of GAC-AnMBR against temperature, which highlighted the applicational potential of GAC-AnMBR, especially in cold and temperate climate regions.

To better understand nanoplastic mobility in subsurface environments following freezing and thawing cycles, the transport of 28 nm polystyrene nanoplastics exposed to either constant (10 degrees C) temperature or freeze-thaw (FT) cycles (-10 degrees C to 10 degrees C) was investigated in saturated quartz sand. The stability and transport of nanoplastic suspensions were examined both in the presence and absence of natural organic matter (NOM) over a range of ionic strengths (3-100 mM NaCl). Exposure to 10 FT cycles consistently led to significant aggregation and reduced mobility compared to nanoplastics held at 10 degrees C, especially at low ionic strengths in the absence of NOM. While NOM increased nanoplastic mobility, it did not prevent the aggregation of nanoplastics exposed to FT. We compare our findings with existing literature and show that nanoplastics will largely aggregate and associate with soils rather than undergo long range transport in groundwater in colder climates following freezing temperatures. In fact, FT exposure leads to the formation of stable aggregates that are not prone to disaggregation. As one of the first studies to examine the coupled effect of cold temperature and NOM, this work highlights the need to account for climate and temperature changes when assessing the risks associated with nanoplastic release in aquatic systems.

WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						Shallow lake; Eutrophication; Sustainability; Depth; Trophic state; Management	LAND-COVER DATABASE; WATER-QUALITY; AGRICULTURAL EXPANSION; UNITED-STATES; PHOSPHORUS; CLIMATE; NITROGEN; BLOOMS; DEPTH; COMPLETION	Understanding and managing the susceptibility of lakes to anthropogenic eutrophication has been a primary goal of limnological research for decades. To achieve United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, scientists have attempted to understand why shallow lakes appear to be prone to eutrophication and resistant to restoration. A rich data base of 1151 lakes (each >= 0.5 km2) located within the Europe and the United States of America offers a rare opportunity to explore potential answers. Analysis of sites showed that lake depth integrated socioecological systems and reflected potential susceptibility to anthropogenic stressors, as well as lake productivity. In this study, lakes distributed in agricultural plain and densely populated lowland areas were generally shallow and subjected to intense human activities with high external nutrient inputs. In contrast, deep lakes frequently occurred in upland regions, dominated by natural landscapes with little anthropogenic nutrient input. Lake depth appeared to not only reflect external nutrient load to the lake, but also acted as an amplifier that increased shallow lake susceptibility to anthropogenic disturbance. Our findings suggest that shallow lakes are more susceptible to human forcing and their eutrophication may be not an occasional occurrence, and that societal expectations, policy goals, and management plans should reflect this observation.

However, the CH4 and CO2 emissions from urban inland waters are less constrained. In particular, ebullitive CH4 emissions from these waters are poorly understood. Here, we measured the concentrations and fluxes of CH4 and CO2 in rivers and lakes in the megacity of Beijing, China, between 2018 and 2019. The CH4 concentration ranged from 0.08 to 70.2 umol L-1 with an average of 2.5 +/- 5.9 umol L-1. The average CH4 ebullition was 11.3 +/- 30.4 mmol m(-2) d(-1) and was approximately 6 times higher than the global average. The average total CH4 flux (14.2 +/- 35.1 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) was 3 times higher than the global average, with ebullition accounting for 80% of the flux. The high surface water CH4 concentrations and ebullitive fluxes were caused by high sediment organic carbon/dissolved organic carbon contents, high aquatic primary productivity and shallow water depths in the urban inland waters. The CH4 emissions accounted for 20% of CO2 emissions in terms of the carbon release and were 1.7 times higher in terms of CO2 equivalent emissions from Beijing inland waters. Furthermore, the CH4 ebullition and its contribution to the total carbon gas emissions increased exponentially with the water temperature, suggesting a positive feedback probably occurs between the greenhouse gas emissions from urban inland waters and climate warming. This study confirms the major role of CH4 ebullition from urban inland waters in the global carbon budget under the rapid progress of global urbanization. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the extensively managed aquaculture ponds were identified as a hotspot of CH4 emission but just a weak N2O source. Here, we investigate annual CH4 and N2O fluxes from three earthen ponds used for crab culture, of different sizes, in southeast China. Our purposes are to identify the spatiotemporal variations of CH4 and N2O emissions and their components among ponds and to evaluate the zone for CH4 and N2O production. Static chamber-measured CH4 flux ranged from 0.03 to 64.7 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) (average: 9.02-14.3 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)), and temperature, followed by dissolved organic C (DOC) concentration, and redox potential, were the primary drivers of seasonal CH4 flux patterns. Annual mean diffusive CH4 flux was 1.80-2.34 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1), and that by ebullition was up to 7.20-12.0 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) (79.1-83.5% of the total CH4 flux). Annual CH4 emission was positively correlated with sediment DOC concentration but negatively (P < 0.05) correlated with water depth across ponds, with the highest CH4 emission occurred in a pond with low water depth and high DOC concentration. The calculated diffusive N2O flux by the gas transfer velocity was 0.32-0.60 times greater than the measured N2O emission, suggesting that N2O in water column can not only evade as water-air fluxes but diffuse downwards and to be consumed in anaerobic sediments. This also indicates that N2O was primarily produced in water column. The highly reduced condition and depletion of NO3--N in sediments, can limit N2O production from both nitrification and denitrification but favor N2O consumption, leading the ponds to become a weak source of N2O annually and even a sink of N2O in summer. Our results highlight that the current global CH4 budget for inland waters is probably underestimated due to a lack of data and underestimation of the contribution of ebullitive CH4 flux in small lentic waters. The downwards N2O diffusion from the water column into sediment also indicates that the extensively-used model approach based on gas transfer velocity potentially overestimates N2O fluxes, especially in small eutrophic aquatic ecosystems.

Recently, eutrophication has become an important environmental issue in global lakes, but how eutrophication drives changes in the molecular composition of DOM along trophic gradients remains poorly understood. We thus characterized 67 DOM isolates from 11 lakes along a trophic gradient in China by using a combined approach including absorption spectroscopy, excitation-emission matrix fluorescence and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). Our results indicated that dissolved organic carbon and absorption coefficients at 350 nm increased with increasing trophic status index. The ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm and fluorescence intensity of all fluorescent components were higher in eutrophic lakes than in oligotrophic lakes. DOM in high trophic state lakes tended to be dominated by higher molecular weight, unsaturation degree, greater abundance of S -containing compounds, and condensed or polycyclic aromatic compounds than oligotrophic lakes. Additionally, autochthonous DOM characterized by more aliphatic compounds increased with the increasing trophic state. We concluded that nutrient input along with allochthonous DOM favors the lake eutrophication and subsequently increases the release and accumulation of autochthonous DOM. Consequently, eutrophication modifies the structure of the organic matter into more complex materials with increased input of allochthonous DOM and increased release of autochthonous DOM, which could accelerate global carbon cycle processes. Our results here have potential to contribute significantly to future studies of DOM dynamics in eutrophic lakes.

The ALBA model is based on mass balances of COD, C, N and P, but also H and O. It describes growth and interactions among algae, heterotrophic and nitrifying bacteria, while local climate drives light and temperature. Relevant chemical/physical processes are also included. The minimum-law was used as ground principle to describe the multi-limitation kinetics. The model was setup and calibrated with an original data set recorded on a 56 m(2) raceway located in the South of France, continuously treating synthetic wastewater. The main process variables were daily measured along 443 days of operations and dissolved O-2 and pH were on-line recorded. A sub-dataset was used for calibration and the model was successfully validated, along the different seasons over a period of 414 days. The model proved to be effective in reproducing both the short term nycthemeral dynamics and the long-term seasonal ones. The analysis of different scenarios reveals the fate of nitrogen and the key role played by oxygen and CO2 in the interactions between the different players of the ecosystem. On average, the process turns out to be CO2 neutral, as compared to a standard activated sludge where approximately half of the influent carbon will end up in the atmosphere. The ALBA model revealed that a suboptimal regulation of the paddle wheel can bring to several detrimental impacts. At high velocity, the strong aeration will reduce the available oxygen provided by photo-oxygenation, while very low aeration can rapidly lead to oxygen inhibition of the photosynthetic process. On the other hand, during night, the paddle wheel is fundamental to ensure enough oxygen in the system to support algal-bacteria respiration. The model can be used to support advanced control strategies, including smart regulation of the paddle wheel velocity to more efficiently balance the mixing, aeration and degassing effects.

Relationships among microbial indicators of fecal pollution, microbial source tracking markers, and pathogens in Costa Rican coastal waters	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						Recreational water quality; HF183; Coliphage; Norovirus; Pepper mild mottle virus; MST	MILD MOTTLE VIRUS; REAL-TIME PCR; RISK-ASSESSMENT; GASTROINTESTINAL ILLNESS; BACTERIAL PATHOGENS; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; DIVERSE MICROBES; ENTERIC VIRUSES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WASTE-WATER	Tropical coastal waters are understudied, despite their ecological and economic importance. They also reflect projected climate change scenarios for other climate zones, e.g., increased rainfall and water temperatures. We conducted an exploratory microbial water quality study at a tropical beach influenced by sewage-contaminated rivers, and tested the hypothesis that fecal microorganisms (fecal coliforms, enterococci, Clostridium perfringens, somatic and male-specific coliphages, pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), Bacteroides HF183, norovirus genogroup I (NoVGI), Salmonella, Cryptosporidium and Giardia) would vary by season and tidal stage. Most microorganisms' concentrations were greater in the rainy season; however, NoVGI was only detected in the dry season and Cryptosporidium was the only pathogen most frequently detected in rainy season. Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) levels exceeded recreational water quality criteria standards in >85% of river samples and in <50% of ocean samples, regardless of the FIB or regulatory criterion. Chronic sewage contamination was demonstrated by detection of HF183 and PMMoV in 100% of river samples, and in >89% of ocean samples. Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Salmonella, and NoVGI were frequently detected in rivers (39%, 39%, 26%, and 39% of samples, respectively), but infrequently in ocean water, particularly during the dry season. Multivariate analysis showed that C. perfringens, somatic coliphage, male-specific coliphage, and PMMoV were the subset of indicators that maximized the correlation with pathogens in the rivers. In the ocean, the best subset of indicators was enterococci, male-specific coliphage, and PMMoV. We also executed redudancy analyses on environmental parameters and microorganim concentrations, and found that rainfall best predicted microbial concentrations. The seasonal interplay of rainfall and pathogen prevalence undoubtedly influences beach users' health risks. Relationships are likely to be complex, with some risk factors increasing and others decreasing each season. Future use of multivariate approaches to better understand linkages among environmental conditions, microbial predictors (fecal indicators and MST markers), and pathogens will improve prediction of high-risk scenarios at recreational beaches.

However, few studies have simultaneously evaluated the relative importance of these factors on the effect of community composition and biomass of phytoplankton. The relative importance of the water quality physicochemical parameters (water temperature [WT], total nitrogen [TN], total phos-phorus [TP], pH, dissolved oxygen [DO], electrical conductivity [EC], turbidity and Secchi depth [SD]), land use (built-up land, farmland, waters, forest, grassland, and unused land) in the watershed, and lake mor-phology (area and depth) on the composition and biomass of phytoplankton communities were assessed in 29 subtropical shallow lakes in Wuhan, China, during different seasons from December 2017 to Novem-ber 2018. The results showed that phytoplankton in all 29 lakes was mainly composed of Cyanophyta, Chlorophyta, and Bacillariophyta. Phytoplankton abundance was highest in summer and lowest in winter. We analyzed the relative importance of the three groups of variables to the community composition of the phytoplankton by variance decomposition. The results showed that the three groups of environmental variables had the highest explanation rate (> 80%) for the composition of the phytoplankton community in summer and autumn, and the explanation rates in spring and winter were 42.1% and 39.8%, respec-tively. The water quality physicochemical parameters were the most important variables affecting the composition of phytoplankton communities, followed by land use in the watershed. Through generalized additive model and structural equation model analysis, we found that the land use and lake morphology had minimal direct impact on the Chl-a and cell density of phytoplankton, mainly by altering the TN, TP, turbidity, SD, DO, and EC, which indirectly affected phytoplankton. WT and nutrients were still the main predictors of phytoplankton abundance. Built-up land was the main source of nitrogen and phosphorus in lakes. Correlation analysis found that forest and grassland had positive impacts on reducing lake nitro-gen and phosphorus contents. This showed that increasing grassland and forest in the watershed could reduce the pollutants entering the lake. Our findings will contribute to water quality management and pollution control for subtropical shallow lakes. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the mechanisms by which natural vegetation restoration affects the extent, rate, and temperature sensitivity of DOM biodegradation are poorly understood. Elucidating these mechanisms is important for SOM management, especially in light of future climate warming scenarios. In this study, a laboratory DOM solution incubation experiment was conducted to comprehensively investigate the effects of temperature and natural vegetation restoration spanning a period of 160 y on DOM biodegradation in the Loess Plateau, China. The results indicated that dissolved organic C (DOC) biodegradation significantly decreased with vegetation restoration after an incubation period of 60 d. Further, biodegradation of dissolved organic N (DON) and dissolved organic P (DOP) significantly decreased after farmland abandonment. Specifically, the lowest values were observed in pioneer (Populus davidiana) and mingled (Populus davidiana and Quercus liaotungensis) forests. Generally, an increase in temperature significantly promoted the biodegradation of DOC, DON, and DOP by enhancing the microbial utilisation efficiencies of recalcitrant humic substrates (i.e., low-molecular-weight humic materials). Our results suggest that DOM biodegradability and its temperature sensitivity were regulated by DOM substrate quality (i.e, recalcitrant humic materials), and microbial properties (i.e., gram-negative bacterial and fungal PLFA, enzyme activities). Additionally, our results suggest that climax forest communities (Quercus liaotungensis) played a vital role in reducing DOC and DOP losses. This could be attributed to the low Q10 of the DOC and DOP biodegradation rates. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the high carbon dioxide (CO2) content in biogas limits its value as a fuel. 'Biogas upgrading' is an advanced process which removes CO2 from biogas, thereby converting biogas to biomethane, which has a higher commercial value. Microbial technologies offer a sustainable and cost-effective way to upgrade biogas, removing CO2 using hydrogen (H-2) as electron donor, generated by surplus electricity from renewable wind or solar energy. Hydrogenotrophic methanogens can be applied to convert CO2 with H-2 to methane (CH4), or alternatively, homoacetogens can convert both CO2 and H-2 into value-added chemicals. Here, we comprehensively review the current state of biogas generation and utilization, and describe the advances in biological, H-2-dependent biogas upgrading technologies, with particular attention to key challenges associated with the processes, e.g., metabolic limitations, low H-2 transfer rate, and finite CO2 conversion rate. We also highlight several new strategies for overcoming technical barriers to achieve efficient CO2 conversion, including process optimization to eliminate metabolic limitation, novel reactor designs to improve H-2 transfer rate and utilization efficiency, and employing advanced genetic engineering tools to generate more efficient microorganisms. The insights offered in this review will promote further exploration into microbial, H-2-driven biogas upgrading, towards addressing the global energy crisis and climate change associated with use of fossil fuels.

Linear or Bayesian algorithms on isotope and n-alkanes have been widely used to identify the source proportion of organic carbon. However, the applicability of these methods is ambiguous because of the unilateral advantages of each model and trace factors. To test the applicability of the various methods for identifying POC sources, we analyzed dual isotopes and n-alkanes in surface water samples of Lake Taihu, and Multi-source mixing model and Bayesian mixing model were used to distinguish between endogenous and exogenous contributions. Carbon isotope presented a clear advantage in West Taihu (-21.85 ? 0.78 ? ) and Southwest Taih (-22.61 ? 1.35 ? ); nitrogen isotope also showed high values in Meiliang Bay (9.76 ? 0.92 ? ). The majority of the lake was dominated by short-chain n-alkanes, except for East Taihu Lake (dominated by medium-chain n-alkanes) and areas with riverine input (dominated by long-chain n-alkanes). Different principles between the Bayesian mixing model (based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm) and the Multi-source mixing model (based on linear estimation) caused discrepancies in the estimations of source contributions. But the fraction of chemical compounds during the migration process, and the overlap of potential sources play important role in the inconsistency of results. The estimations from the different models were consistent in indicating the dominance of endogenous organic carbon in Lake Taihu (mean of 60.18 ? 20.26%), particularly in the north and western regions (West Taihu, Meiliang Bay, and Southwest Taihu). This was likely due to algal aggregation influenced by human activities and climatic factors. ? 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To better understand their sources and molecular composition in the atmosphere, rainwater samples were collected at six different locations along the Yangtze River Basin. Based on the application of a combined approach including excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS), various sources (terrestrial, anthropogenic, and autochthonous sources) of rainwater DOM were revealed. Results show that the derivatives of biogenic volatile organic compounds were widely distributed and contributed to rainwater DOM along the Yangtze River Basin. In the up-river city Batang, rainwater DOM was affected by the long-range atmospheric transport due to the Indian summer monsoon. Lijiang, a city on the southeastern edge of Tibetan plateau, was related to strong local biomass burning. The industrial cities of Panzhihua and Luzhou showed large differences in organic composition due to distinct industrial types. Fuling, a district in Chongqing Municipality, was significantly contributed by aged organics from biomass burning. While rainwater DOM in Shanghai, a coastal megacity, contained a high fraction of sea spray organics. Further, more than 70% of rainwater DOM molecules are associated with 36 typical transformation mechanisms during rainwater-scavenging processes, e.g., oxidation reactions, dealkylation and decarboxylation. Our study demonstrates that local natural and anthropogenic emissions and climatic conditions strongly shaped the chemodiversity and possible precursor-product pairs of rainwater DOM along the Yangtze River Basin, which helps to better understand the biogeochemical cycles of organic matter in a large-scale watershed under the influence of human activities.

Factors controlling CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes include eutrophication and warming, but the integrated influence of climate-warming driven stratification, oxygen loss and resultant changes in bloom characteristics on GHGs are not well understood. Here we assessed the influence of contrasting meteorological conditions on stratification and phytoplankton bloom composition in a eutrophic lake, and tested for associated changes in GHGs inventories in both the shallow and deep waters, over three seasons (2010-2012). Atmospheric heatwaves had one of the most dramatic effects on GHGs. Indeed, cyanobacterial blooms that developed in response to heatwave events in 2012 enhanced both sedimentary CH4 concentrations (reaching up to 1mM) and emissions to the atmosphere (up to 8 mmol m & minus;2 d & minus;1). That summer, CH4 contributed 52% of the integrated warming potential of GHGs produced in the lake (in CO2 equivalents) as compared to between 34 and 39% in years without cyanobacterial blooms. High CH4 accumulation and subsequent emission in 2012 were preceded by CO2 and N2O consumption and under-saturation at the lake surface (uptakes at 30 mmol m(-2) d(-1) and -1.6 mu mol m(-2) d(-1), respectively). Fall overturn presented a large efflux of N2O and CH4, particularly from the littoral zone after the cyanobacterial bloom. We provide evidence that, despite cooling observed at depth during hot summers, CH4 emissions increased via stronger stratification and surface warming, resulting in enhanced cyanobacterial biomass deposition and intensified bottom water anoxia. Our results, supported by recent literature reports, suggests a novel interplay between climate change effects on lake hydrodynamics that impacts both bloom characteristics and GHGs production in shallow eutrophic lakes. Given global trends of warming and enrichment, these interactive effects should be considered to more accurately predict the future global role of lakes in GHG emissions. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Rapid winter warming and increasing observations of winter blooms warrant more investigation of these controls. We investigated the mechanisms regulating a massive winter diatom bloom in a temperate lake. High frequency data and process-based lake modeling demonstrated that phytoplankton growth in winter was dually controlled by light and temperature, rather than by light alone. Water temperature played a further indirect role in initiating the bloom through ice-thaw, which increased light exposure. The bloom was ultimately terminated by silicon limitation and sedimentation. These mechanisms differ from those typically responsible for spring diatom blooms and contributed to the high peak biomass. Our findings show that phytoplankton growth in winter is more sensitive to temperature, and consequently to climate change, than previously assumed. This has implications for nutrient cycling and seasonal succession of lake phytoplankton communities. The present study exemplifies the strength in integrating data analysis with different temporal resolutions and lake modeling. The new lake ecological model serves as an effective tool in analyzing and predicting winter phytoplankton dynamics for temperate lakes. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Zhang, XY; Gu, J; Liu, Y				Zhang, Xiaoyuan; Gu, Jun; Liu, Yu			Necessity of direct energy and ammonium recovery for carbon neutral municipal wastewater reclamation in an innovative anaerobic MBR-biochar adsorption-reverse osmosis process	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						Anaerobic MBR; Biochar adsorption; Reverse osmosis; Municipal wastewater reclamation; Energy and resource recovery; Carbon neutrality	MEMBRANE; PLANT	With the speedy evolution of global climate change and water shortage, there is a growing need for the energy and carbon neutral wastewater reclamation technology. To tackle this challenge, an innovative anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR)-biochar adsorption-RO process was developed for reclaiming municipal wastewater to high-grade product water with the aims for achieving the energy and carbon neutrality. It was found that about 95.6% of influent COD was removed by AnMBR with direct generation of biomethane, while ammonium-N in AnMBR permeate was fully recovered through biochar adsorption. The effluent from biochar adsorber with significantly lowered divalent ions concentrations was further reclaimed by RO at reduced cost and energy consumption. The energy demand and the total carbon emissions in the proposed process were estimated to be 0.50 kWh/m(3) and 633 g CO(2)e/m(3) against 0.86 kWh/m(35) and 1101 g CO(2)e/m(3) in the current conventional activated sludge (CAS)-microfiltration-RO process. It was further shown that the ammonium recovery via biochar adsorption could offset about 0.503 kWh/m(3) that was originally utilized for chemically producing recovered ammonia by the Haber-Bosch method, equivalent to a carbon offsetting of 498 g CO(2)e/m(3), leading to a net carbon emission of 135 CO(2)e/m(3) in the proposed process, which was only about 12% of that in the current CAS-MF-RO process. These suggested that a carbon-neutral municipal wastewater reclamation might be achievable through concurrent carbon reduction and offsetting, while carbon offsetting via ammonia recovery appeared to be a game-changer towards the carbon-neutral operation. Consequently, it is expected that this study can shed lights on how energy- and carbon-neutrality would be achieved by innovating municipal wastewater reclamation technology.

Adaptive pressure-driven multi-criteria spatial decision-making for a targeted placement of green and grey runoff control infrastructures	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						multi-criteria decision-making; green and grey infrastructure; spatial planning; pressure-state-response framework; adaptive pressure-driven adjustment	LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; STORMWATER; RESILIENCE; SELECTION; SERVICES; SUPPORT; DPSIR	Traditional runoff control measures ignore the spatial imbalance of regional pressures, thereby failing to achieve a site-specific placement for green and grey infrastructure simultaneously. A multi-criterion decision-making framework for runoff control infrastructure spatial planning was therefore developed in this study. The pressurestate-response framework was applied to creatively match the pressure induced adjustment demands with the infrastructure effectiveness. The pressures were quantified from the perspective of environment, economy, and ecology on a grid scale. States were considered as the relative priority of regional pressure adjustment demand in multiple perspectives. Responses were presented as state-targeted green and grey infrastructure placement. Multi-perspective effectiveness of different green and grey infrastructure was simultaneously evaluated at an effective scale of controlling 1 m3/s runoff for comparison. Methods such as data mining, hydrological model simulation, and remote sensing inversion were combined to quantify the regional pressures. The capital investment and ecological impact of infrastructures were quantified from a life cycle perspective. A case study was carried out in Wuhan, China. The study area was clustered by gridded pressure into three regions. In region I, ecological and environmental pressure were of higher weight. In region II, the environmental pressure was dominant. In region III, the ecological pressure took precedence over the environmental and economic constraints. The area ratios of the region I, II, and III were 43%, 36%, and 21% respectively. The result indicated a synergy and spatial heterogeneity of multi-perspective pressures, and further demonstrating that expert experience tends to fail to weigh the multi-function of green and grey infrastructures for coping with the pressures. Results also stated that green infrastructures were more acceptable in areas that aspire to achieve simultaneous runoff control and ecological improvement. The decision-making framework developed in this study can maximize the overall performance by providing targeted infrastructure placement solutions.

Yet the complex interplay between climatic variables and lake processes makes prediction of phytoplankton biomass a rather difficult task. Quantifying the relative influence of climate-related variables on the regulation of phytoplankton biomass requires modelling approaches that use extensive field measurements paired with accurate meteorological observations. In this study we used climate and lake related variables obtained from the ERAS-Land reanalysis dataset combined with a large dataset of in-situ measurements of chlorophyll-a and phytoplankton biomass from 50 water bodies to develop models of phytoplankton related responses as functions of the climate reanalysis data. We used chlorophyll-a and phytoplankton biomass as response metrics of phytoplankton growth and we employed two different modelling techniques, boosted regression trees (BRT) and generalized additive models for location scale and shape (GAMLSS). According to our results, the fitted models had a relatively high explanatory power and predictive performance. Boosted regression trees had a high pseudo R-2 with the type of the lake, the total layer temperature, and the mix-layer depth being the three predictors with the higher relative influence. The best GAMLSS model retained mix-layer depth, mix-layer temperature, total layer temperature, total runoff and 10-m wind speed as significant predictors (p<0.001). Regarding the phytoplankton biomass both modelling approaches had less explanatory power than those for chlorophyll-a. Concerning the predictive performance of the models both the BRT and GAMLSS models for chlorophyll-a outperformed those for phytoplankton biomass. Overall, we consider these findings promising for future limnological studies as they bring forth new perspectives in modelling ecosystem responses to a wide range of climate and lake variables. As a concluding remark, climate reanalysis can be an extremely useful asset for lake research and management. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the mainstream application of PN/A still faces the challenges of low nitrogen concentration and low temperatures, and has not been studied under a realistic condition of large-scale reactor (kiloliter level), real municipal wastewater (MWW) and seasonal temperatures. In this research, a pilot-scale one -stage PN/A, with integrated fixed-film activated sludge (IFAS) configuration, was operated to treat the real MWW pretreated by anaerobic membrane bioreactor. The removal efficiency of total nitrogen (TN) was 79.4%, 75.7% and 65.9% at 25, 20 and 15 degrees C, corresponding to the effluent TN of 7.3, 9.7 and 12.0 mg/L, respectively. The suppression of ammonium-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and anammox bacteria (AnAOB) occurred at lower temperatures, and the significant decrease in AOB treatment capacity was the reason for the poorer nitrogen removal at 15 degrees C. Biomass retention and microbial segregation were successfully achieved. Specifically, Candi-datus_Brocadia and Candidatus_Kuenenia were main AnAOB genera and mainly enriched on carriers, Nitro-somonas and uncultured f_Chitinophagaceae were main AOB genera and mainly distributed in suspended sludge and retained by sedimentation tank. Moreover, nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) were sufficiently suppressed by intermittent aeration and low dissolved oxygen, the presence of heterotrophic bacteria upgraded the PN/A to a simultaneous partial nitritation, anammox, denitrification, and COD oxidation (SNADCO) system, which improved the overall removal of TN and COD. The results of this investigation clearly evidence the strong feasibility of PN/A as a mainstream nitrogen removal process in temperate climates.

In the East China Sea (ECS), large-scale blooms caused by dinoflagellates occurred since 2000 and there has been an apparent shift of bloom-causative microalgae from diatoms to dinoflagellates. To predict the future evolution of HABs in this region, a model was developed based on the competition between diatoms and dinoflagellates, which would serve to reproduce the seasonal succession of microalgal blooms driven by multiple environmental factors. The evolution features of HABs were then projected under different scenarios of eutrophication and global warming. Under the 'business as usual' scenario, dinoflagellate blooms are expected to become more frequent with higher peak biomass concentrations over the next 30 years. Changes in nutrient composition of the Changjiang riverine discharge may largely give rise to this phenomenon, and accelerated warming associated with climate change may result in earlier occurrence of dinoflagellate blooms. To prevent further intensification of dinoflagellate blooms, efforts could be made to reduce nitrogen inputs and maintain or even increase silicate inputs from the Changjiang river.

For this purpose, laboratory-scale batch experiments were conducted with the separated suspended sludge and the carrier-attached biofilm of every system in triplicate. For all batches the removal of 31 MPs as well as the composition of the microbial community were analyzed. The carrier-attached biofilms from two hybrid MBBR systems showed a significant higher overall transformation potential in comparison to the respective suspended sludge. Especially for the MPs trimethoprim, diclofenac, mecoprop, climbazole and the human metabolite 10,11-dihydro-10-hydroxycarbamazepine consistently higher pseudo-first-order transformation rates could be observed in all three systems. The analysis of the taxonomic composition revealed taxa showing higher relative abundances in the carrier-attached biofilms (e. g. Nitrospirae and Chloroflexi) and in the suspended biomasses (e. g. Bacteroidetes and Betaproteobacteria). Correlations of the biodiversity indices and the MP biotransformation rates resulted in significant positive associations for 11 compounds in suspended sludge, but mostly negative associations for the carrier-attached biofilms. The distinct differences in MP removal between suspended sludge and carrier-attached biofilm of the three different MBBR systems were also reflected by a statistically significant link between the occurrence of specific bacterial taxa (Acidibacter, Nitrospira and Rhizomicrobium) and MP transformation rates of certain MPs. Even though the identified correlations might not necessarily be of causal nature, some of the identified taxa might serve as suitable indicators for the transformation potential of suspended sludge or carrier-attached biofilms.

Adaptation of anammox bacteria to low temperature via gradual acclimation and cold shocks: Distinctions in protein expression, membrane composition and activities	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						Adaptation; Anammox; Cold shock; Gradually decreasing temperature; Kuenenia; Main stream of municipal sewage	LADDERANE LIPID DISTRIBUTION; NITROGEN REMOVAL; NITRITATION	Anammox bacteria enable efficient removal of nitrogen from sewage in processes involving partial nitritation and anammox (PN/A) or nitrification, partial denitrification, and anammox (N-PdN/A). In mild climates, anammox bacteria must be adapted to <15 degrees C, typically by gradual temperature decrease; however, this takes months or years. To reduce the time necessary for the adaptation, an unconventional method of 'cold shocks' is promising, involving hours-long exposure of anammox biomass to extremely low temperatures. We compared the efficacies of gradual temperature decrease and cold shocks to increase the metabolic activity of anammox (fed batch reactor, planktonic "Ca. Kuenenia"). We assessed the cold shock mechanism on the level of protein expression (quantitative shot-gun proteomics, LC-HRMS/MS) and the structure of membrane lipids (UPLC-HRMS/MS). The shocked culture was more active (0.66 +/- 0.06 vs 0.48 +/- 0.06 kg-N/kg-VSS/d) and maintained the relative content of N-respiration proteins at levels consistent levels with the initial state, whereas the content of these proteins decreased in gradually acclimated culture. Cold shocks also induced a more efficient expression of potential cold shock proteins (e.g. ppiD, UspA, pqqC), while putative cold shock proteins CspB and TypA were upregulated in both cultures. Ladderane lipids characteristic for anammox evolved to a similar endpoint in both cultures; this confirms their role in anammox bacteria adaptation to cold and indicates a three pronged adaptation mechanism (ladderane alkyl length, introduction of shorter non-ladderane alkyls, polar headgroup). Overall, we show the outstanding potential of cold shocks for low-temperature adaptation of anammox bacteria and provide yet unreported detailed mechanisms of anammox adaptation to low temperatures.

However, the daily water yield of currently reported SAWH devices remains low to satisfy the rising demand for drinking water. The sorption and desorption kinetics, long-term stability and especially facile scaling-fabrication of adsorbents and scaled-up device implementation have become the bottleneck to such large-scale SAWH application. To overcome these challenges, an air-cooled SAWH device was fabricated to investigate its atmo-spheric water harvesting (AWH) performance under real island climate and its feasibility of multicyclic opera-tion. Under monocyclic operation, the device demonstrated the superior water productivity as much as 3.9 kg day(-1), or 0.39 kgwater kg(adsorbent)-(1) day(-1), at 31 degrees C and 70% RH, with a thermal efficiency of 25.4% (desorption at 94 degrees C). The SAWH device demonstrated successful water production through 2 adsorption-desorption cycles within one day, with increased thermal efficiency to as high as 32.2% and increased water harvesting perfor-mance up to 0.42 kgwater kg(adsorbent)(-1) day(-1) by 20-90%. This is the first demonstration in multicyclic SAWH at large scales, holding the promise of large-scale and practical water supply in island areas while opening up new applications such as indoor dehumidification.

However, how the temporal dynamics of phytoplankton are directly or indirectly linked to anthropogenic activities and climatic oscillation remains unclear. We assessed the annual trends (1988-2018) in phytoplankton abundance (PA) in Lake Dongting, China and related it to five groups of variables characterizing human activities, global climate oscillation, water nutrients, hydrology, and meteorology. We found a significant increase in PA, urbanization (Upop), total nitrogen (TN), fertilizer application (FA), number of summer days (SU), and the warm speed duration index (WSDI) and a significant decrease in the water discharge of three inlets (TIWD) and the sediment discharge of three inlets (TISD) and four tributaries (FTSD) and the net sediment deposition (NSD). However, no significant annual trends were observed for the number of rainstorm days (R50mm), the simple precipitation intensity index (SDII) and yearly anomalies of El Nino-Southern oscillation events (ENSOi). Cross-correlation Function analyses demonstrated that the operation of the Three George Dam (TGD) strengthened the effects of hydrology, rainfall patterns and ENSOi on phytoplankton, but strongly weakened the association between water nutrients, human activities and phytoplankton abundance. Path analysis revealed that TP, TN, FA, R50 mm as well as WSDI had a direct positive effect on PA, while a direct negative effect was found for ENSOi, NSD and TISD. Human activities (Upop and FA), warming (WSDI and SU), and rainfall patterns (SDII and R50 mm) exerted indirect controls on phytoplankton through changes in water nutrients and hydrology. Climate change (ENSOi) had a direct effect on PA, but also showed twelve indirect pathways via changes in hydrology and meteorology (both positive and negative effects were found). Overall, meteorology contributed most markedly to the variations of PA (29.3%), followed by hydrology (25.3%), human activities (24%), water nutrients (10.5%), and ENSOi (1.9%). Our results highlight a strongly causal connection between human activities as well as global climate change and phytoplankton and the benefits of considering multiple environmental drivers in determining the temporal dynamics of lake biotic communities.

Yet, each lake is unique, leading to large inter-lake variation in lake vulnerability to algal blooms. Here, we aim to assess the effects of unique lake characteristics on lake vulnerability to algal blooms. To this end, we built a novel and comprehensive database of lake morphometric, climate and sediment characteristics of 19,536 Chinese lakes, including ponds and reservoirs (>0.1 km2). We assessed lake characteristics for nine stratification classes and show that lakes, including ponds and reservoirs, in eastern China typically have a warm stratification class (Tavg>4 degrees C) and are slightly deeper than those in western China. Model results for representative lakes suggest that the most vulnerable lakes to algal blooms are in eastern China where pollution levels are also highest. Our characterization provides an important baseline to inform policymakers in what regions lakes are potentially most vulnerable to algal blooms.	[Janssen, Annette B.

They are present in freshwater environments all over the world and are known to cause harmful algal blooms, although their effects are not well understood. Algal blooms are important to manage because they threaten freshwater resources, with potentially severe effects on ecological and human health. There is also increased urgency due to urbanization and climate change trends which are expected to exacerbate these bloom dynamics. These changes are expected to especially favour picocyanobacteria groups, emphasizing the need for better characterization of their effects in the environment. In this study, we report the discovery that Synechococcus sp. could produce cylindrospermopsin (CYN) and anatoxin-a (ATX). This ability had never been previously reported for this species. Their toxin genes were also partial compared to other major producers such as Raphidiopsis sp. and Anabaena sp., demonstrating potentially unique synthesis pathways that provides insight into the various mechanisms of genetic variation that drives toxin synthesis. The Synechococcus sp. strains were found to produce about 9.0 x 10(-5) -6.8 x 10(-4) fg CYN cell(-1) and 4.7 x 10(-4) -1.5 x 10(-2) fg ATX cell(-1). The potential for Synechococcus sp. to be toxic highlights a global concern due to its widespread distribution, and through environmental trends that increasingly favour its productivity within freshwater systems around the world.

In temperate regions, it is challenging to quantify the impacts of deforestation on the catchment dynamics and downstream aquatic ecosystems such as reservoirs and disentangle these from direct climate change impacts, let alone project future changes to inform management. Here, we tackled this issue by investigating a unique catchment-reservoir system with two reservoirs in distinct trophic states (meso- and eutrophic), both of which drain into the largest drinking water reservoir in Germany. Due to the prolonged droughts in 2015-2018, the catchment of the mesotrophic reservoir lost an unprecedented area of forest (exponential increase since 2015 and ca. 17.1% loss in 2020 alone). We coupled catchment nutrient exports (HYPE) and reservoir ecosystem dynamics (GOTM-WET) models using a process-based modeling approach. The coupled model was validated with datasets spanning periods of rapid deforestation, which makes our future projections highly robust. Results show that in a short-term time scale (by 2035), increasing nutrient flux from the catchment due to vast deforestation (80% loss) can turn the mesotrophic reservoir into a eutrophic state as its counterpart. Our results emphasize the more prominent impacts of deforestation than the direct impact of climate warming in impairment of water quality and ecological services to downstream aquatic ecosystems. Therefore, we propose to evaluate the impact of climate change on temperate reservoirs by incorporating a time scale-dependent context, highlighting the indirect impact of deforestation in the short-term scale. In the long-term scale (e.g. to 2100), a guiding hypothesis for future research may be that indirect effects (e.g., as mediated by catchment dynamics) are as important as the direct effects of climate warming on aquatic ecosystems.
