The accuracy of energy statistics is essential for mitigation strategies and evaluating the performance of low carbon energy transition efforts. This study provides the most up-to-date emission inventories for China and its provinces for 2018 and 2019. We also update the carbon dioxide (CO2) emission inventories of China and 30 provinces since 2012 based on the newly revised energy statistics. The inventories are compiled in a combined accounting approach of scope 1 (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change territorial emissions from 17 types of fossil fuel combustion and cement production by 47 socioeconomic sectors) and scope 2 (emissions from purchased electricity and heat consumption). The most recent energy revision led to an increase in reported national CO2 emissions by an average of 0.3% from 2014 to 2017. The results show that data revisions raised China's carbon intensity mitigation baseline (in 2005) by 5.1%-10.8% and thus made it more challenging to fulfill the mitigation pledges. However, the 2020 carbon intensity mitigation target was achieved ahead of schedule in 2018. A preliminary estimate of China's national emissions for 2020 shows that the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown was not able to offset China's annual increase in CO2 emissions. These emissions inventories provide an improved evidence base for China's policies toward net-zero emissions.

Here we use station data and high-resolution simulations from the WRF convection permitting climate model (similar to 4 km, 1 h) over the US to assess future changes in hourly precipitation extremes. It is demonstrated that hourly precipitation extremes and storm depths are expected to intensify under climate change and what is now a 20-year rainfall will become a 7-year rainfall on average for similar to 75% of gridpoints over the US. This intensification is mostly expressed as an increase in rainfall tail heaviness. Statistically significant changes in the seasonality and duration of rainfall extremes are also exhibited over similar to 95% of the domain. Our results suggest more non-linear future precipitation extremes with shorter spell duration that are distributed more uniformly throughout the year.

J	Luo, M; Lau, NC				Luo, Ming; Lau, Ngar-Cheung			Increasing Human-Perceived Heat Stress Risks Exacerbated by Urbanization in China: A Comparative Study Based on Multiple Metrics	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						apparent temperature; climate change; heat index; heat stress; heatwave; urban agglomerations in China; urbanization effect; wet-bulb temperature	SUMMER HEAT; TEMPERATURE; CLIMATE; TRENDS; HUMIDITY; STATIONS; IMPACT	More than half of the total population in China are living in cities. Especially, the people in highly developed and spatially integrated city clusters, i.e., urban agglomerations (UAs), are facing increasing human-perceived heat stress that describes the combined effects of hot temperature, high humidity, and lowered surface wind speed. By analyzing multiple indicators over 20 major UAs across China, we demonstrate that summer heat stress has been significantly intensifying in nearly all UAs during 1971-2014. This intensification is more profound in northern than southern regions and is especially stronger in more urbanized and densely populated areas (e.g., Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and the Yangtze River Delta). Based on a dynamic classification of weather stations using time-varying land use/land cover maps, we find that urban core areas exhibit distinctly stronger increasing heat stress trends than their surrounding rural areas. On average, urbanization contributes to approximately one-quarter of the total increase in mean heat stress over urban core areas of UAs and nearly half of the total increase in extreme heat stress events. The urbanization effect is also dependent on the geographical region within China. Urbanization tends to have stronger intensifying effects on heat stress in UAs with higher population density in low-altitude areas, while it has a relatively weaker intensifying and even weakening effect in some arid and high-altitude regions. Moreover, as various heat stress metrics may yield different estimations of long-term trend and urbanization contribution, the particular choice of heat stress indicator is of critical importance for investigations on this subject matter.

Climate change could increase the level of compound flood hazard through higher extreme sea levels and river flows. Here, a bivariate flood hazard assessment method is proposed to estimate compound coastal-riverine frequency under current and future climate conditions. A copula-based approach is used to estimate the joint return period (JRP) of compound floods by incorporating sea-level rise (SLR) and changes in peak river flows into the marginal distributions of flood drivers. Specifically, the changes in JRP of compound major coastal-riverine flooding defined based on simultaneous exceedances above major coastal and riverine thresholds, are explored by midcentury. Subsequently, the increase in the probability of occurrence of at least one compound major coastal-riverine flooding for a given period of time is quantified. The proposed compound flood hazard assessment is conducted at 26 paired tidal-riverine stations along the Contiguous United States coast with long-term data and defined flood thresholds. We show that the northeast Atlantic and the western part of the Gulf coasts are experiencing the highest compound major coastal-riverine flood probability under current conditions. However, future SLR scenarios show the highest frequency amplification along the southeast Atlantic coast. The impact of changes in peak river flows is found to be considerably less than that of SLR. Climate change impacts, especially SLR, may lead to more frequent compound events, which cannot be ignored for future adaptation responses in estuary regions.

However, the magnitude, spatial pattern, and evolution characteristics of global silicate rock weathering carbon sink (SCS) remain unclear. To solve this problem, based on high-precision hydrometeorological data (1996-2017) and CMIP5 data (2041-2060), using the Celine model, we calculated the global silicate rock weathering carbon sink flux (SCSF) magnitude and spatio-temporal distribution for 1996-2017. We also predicted the SCSF under two future greenhouse gas emission scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). Then, we produced a spatial data set (0.5 x 0.5) of global SCSF from 1996 to 2017 and found that the global average annual SCSF was 1.67 t/km(2)/yr, and the SCS was 127.11 Tg/yr. In particular, Brazil's silicate rock contribution accounts for nearly a quarter of the global SCS (24.41%). Although the GEM-CO2 model is now widely used, the SCSF, without considering the temperature, may be overestimated by 5.4%, and the maximum contribution of temperature to it can reach 240 kg/km(2)/yr. Moreover, the global SCS is now showing a downward trend, but the global emission of greenhouse gases in the future (2041-2060) will continue to increase the carbon sink capacity (23.8%) due to temperature changes. In summary, we have produced a set of high-resolution spatiotemporal data of the past and the future. The above results fill up the large-scale data gap of SCSF and provide a scientific basis for quantitatively assessing the impact of climate change on SCS.

Event-based storylines can provide a way out of this conundrum by putting emphasis on plausibility rather than probability. This links directly to common practices in disaster risk management using "stress-testing" for emergency preparedness based on events that are conditional on specific and plausible assumptions. Event-based storylines allow for conditional explanations, without full attribution of every causal factor, which is crucial when some aspects of the latter are complex and highly uncertain. Plain Language Summary One of today's major challenges is how to use insights and information from climate sciences to inform decision-making regarding managing risks from climate change, where weather and climate extremes represent a major component of climate-related risk. So far, climate science has taken a probabilistic approach producing large model ensembles and exploring likely ranges, thereby neglecting low-likelihood but potentially high-impact events that pose significant risks to society. Event-based storylines are emerging as an alternative way to explore future high-impact events while taking into account aspects of vulnerability and exposure of the considered system with an emphasis on plausibility rather than probability. This concept links directly to common practices in disaster risk management using "stress-testing" for emergency preparedness based on events that are conditional on specific, but plausible assumptions. When co-developed by climate scientists and stakeholders, event-based storylines can be informed by physical climate and impact modeling and can provide a useful way of communicating and assessing climate-related risk in a specific decision-making context.

Studying compound events often requires a multidisciplinary approach combining domain knowledge of the underlying processes with, for example, statistical methods and climate model outputs. Recently, to aid the development of research on compound events, four compound event types were introduced, namely (a) preconditioned, (b) multivariate, (c) temporally compounding, and (d) spatially compounding events. However, guidelines on how to study these types of events are still lacking. Here, we consider four case studies, each associated with a specific event type and a research question, to illustrate how the key elements of compound events (e.g., analytical tools and relevant physical effects) can be identified. These case studies show that (a) impacts on crops from hot and dry summers can be exacerbated by preconditioning effects of dry and bright springs. (b) Assessing compound coastal flooding in Perth (Australia) requires considering the dynamics of a non-stationary multivariate process. For instance, future mean sea-level rise will lead to the emergence of concurrent coastal and fluvial extremes, enhancing compound flooding risk. (c) In Portugal, deep-landslides are often caused by temporal clusters of moderate precipitation events. Finally, (d) crop yield failures in France and Germany are strongly correlated, threatening European food security through spatially compounding effects. These analyses allow for identifying general recommendations for studying compound events. Overall, our insights can serve as a blueprint for compound event analysis across disciplines and sectors.

An extensive number of heat stress indicators (HSIs) has been developed to measure the associated impacts on human health. Here we calculate eight HSIs for global climate models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). We compare their future trends as function of global mean temperature, with particular focus on highly populated regions. All analyzed HSIs increase significantly (p < 0.01) in all considered regions. Moreover, the different HSIs reveal a substantial spread ranging from trends close to the rate of global mean temperature up to an amplification of more than a factor of two. Trends change considerably when normalizing the HSIs by accounting for the different scales on which they are defined, but the large spread and strong trends remain. Consistently, exceedances of impact-relevant thresholds are strongly increasing globally, including in several densely populated regions, but also show substantial spread across the selected HSIs. The indicators with the highest exceedance rates vary for different threshold levels, suggesting that the large indicator spread is associated both to differences in trend magnitude and the definition of threshold levels. These results highlight the importance of choosing indicators and thresholds that are appropriate for the respective impact under consideration. Additionally, further validation of HSIs regarding their capability to quantify heat impacts on human health on regional-to-global scales would be of great value for assessing global impacts of future heat stress more reliably.

However, the anticipated changes in socioeconomic exposure to heatwaves are still unexplored. Here, we investigate the projected heat stress and associated socioeconomic exposure across South Asia (SA) and its subregions using the newly released ensemble mean of 23 global climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), population, and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) projections. We used two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), namely SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5, and three-time periods, that is, near-term, midterm, and long-term relative to the base period (1985-2005). We found that SA region has the potential for widespread changes to Wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) of 6.5 degrees C, which can exceed the theoretical limits of human tolerance by the mid of 21st century. The SA population's exposure significantly increases during midterm and long-term periods by similar to 750x106 10(6) person-hours under the SSP5-8.5 scenario. The GDP exposure is the greatest for the same period's up to 200x109 10(9) dollar-hours under the SSP2-4.5. Moreover, the foothills Himalayans and northern parts of Pakistan are presently unaffected by WBGT during midterm and long-term periods under both scenarios. Among subregions (hereafter R1, R2, R3, and R4), the frequency of subdaily WBGT is projected to increase in the region R2 and R4 by similar to 70% and similar to 90% under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios relative to the base period. The highest upsurge in exposure is anticipated for R2, including southern Pakistan and southwestern India, followed by R1 and R3. Notably, the climate effect is more dominant than the population, whereas changes in GDP effect contribute to the total change in GDP exposure.

Yet, the extremity of these multi-year dry conditions is not recognized. Here, we provide a comprehensive spatio-temporal assessment of the drought hazard over Europe by benchmarking past exceptional events during the period from 1766 to 2020. We identified the 2018-2020 drought event as a new benchmark having an unprecedented intensity that persisted for more than 2 years, exhibiting a mean areal coverage of 35.6% and an average duration of 12.2 months. What makes this event truly exceptional compared with past events is its near-surface air temperature anomaly reaching +2.8 K, which constitutes a further evidence that the ongoing global warming is exacerbating present drought events. Furthermore, future events based on climate model simulations Coupled Model Intercomparison Project v5 suggest that Europe should be prepared for events of comparable intensity as the 2018-2020 event but with durations longer than any of those experienced in the last 250 years. Our study thus emphasizes the urgent need for adaption and mitigation strategies to cope with such multi-year drought events across Europe.

Time Evolution of the Surface Urban Heat Island	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						urban heat island; diurnal temperature cycle; urban climate models; thermal remote sensing	LOCAL CLIMATE ZONES; AIR-TEMPERATURE; SATELLITE; CITIES; PARAMETERIZATION; CLASSIFICATION; VEGETATION; MODEL; METHODOLOGY; EXCHANGE	Atmospheric and surface urban heat islands (UHI) originate from common energetic processes, but the status of scientific knowledge on their time evolution is highly disparate. The diurnal cycles of atmospheric UHI are well known based on years of continuous measurements in cities; the cycles of surface UHI, however, cannot be measured continuously or in situ. In this article, we aim to reconcile these differences. We begin with a synthesis of previous work on the diurnal evolution of surface UHI, which leads to a novel but historically minded approach to the research problem. The approach involves a combination of microscale and mesoscale urban climate models, each of which is forced with universally described urban and rural surface parameters and atmospheric profiles. With these models, we produce theoretical time-temperature curves for the surface UHI that are comparable to the classic curves of atmospheric UHI. This work prompts a critical look at the use of satellite thermal imagery to assess heat islands and heat risks in cities. To that end, we recommend new and more functional definitions of surface temperature. Conceptually, these represent "incomplete" temperatures defined by specific facets of the urban environment.

However, the spatial-temporal patterns and trends of the CCS and SCS from 1950 to 2099 have not been systematically quantified. Thus, Supported by long-term hydrometeorological data under the RCP8.5, we use the accepted Suchet and Hartmann models to determine the following. First, we found except for the difference in their weathering rates, the SCS covers 37.2 million km(2) more area than the CCS. The CCS Flux (CCSF) and SCS Flux (SCSF) are 5.36 and 1.22 t/km(2)/yr, respectively. Similarly, the Full CCS (FCCS, 0.3 Pg/yr) is more than the Full SCS (FSCS, 0.08 Pg/yr). Furthermore, the CCS (7.01 kg/km(2)) and SCS (3.95 kg/km(2)) are in a state of overall increase. In addition, the mid-to-high latitudes of the northern hemisphere are aggravated by warming (0.03 degrees C) and humidity (0.65 mm), while the decrease in runoff in the mid-latitudes of the southern hemisphere reduces karstification. Specifically, by 2099, the CCSF in the mid-latitudes of the southern hemisphere will decrease by 5.72%. Instead, the CCSF in the northern hemisphere and lower latitudes of the southern hemisphere will exhibit a gentle upward slope. Particularly, the peak regions of the global FCCS (65.63 Tg/yr) and FSCS (33.01 Tg/yr) are the tropical zone. In conclusion, this study contributes a high-resolution and long-time series CS datasets for the CCS and SCS. We provide data and a theory for solving terrestrial carbon sink loss.

Cascading Hazards in the Aftermath of Australia's 2019/2020 Black Summer Wildfires	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article							EROSION	Following an unprecedented drought, Australia's 2019/2020 "Black Summer" fire season caused severe damage, gravely impacting both humans and ecosystems, and increasing susceptibility to other hazards. Heavy precipitation in early 2020 led to flooding and runoff that entrained ash and soil in burned areas, increasing sediment concentration in rivers, and reducing water quality. We exemplify this hazard cascade in a catchment in New South Wales by mapping burn severity, flood, and rainfall recurrence; estimating changes in soil erosion; and comparing them with river turbidity data. We show that following the extreme drought and wildfires, even moderate rain and floods led to undue increases in soil erosion and reductions in water quality. While natural risk analysis and planning commonly focuses on a single hazard, we emphasize the need to consider the entire hazard cascade, and highlight the impacts of ongoing climate change beyond its direct effect on wildfires. Plain Language Summary In 2019/2020, a chain of natural hazards impacted Australia's East Coast. Following the severest drought since weather records began, record-breaking wildfires known as the "Black Summer" ravaged the region for months. In early 2020, the rainfall that extinguished the last of these fires caused further damage, as the burned soils repelled much of the rain. Water took the exposed soil and charred vegetation with it on its way to the rivers, flooding streets and polluting drinking water. We show an example of this cascade of hazards in a single river catchment. We found that after the wildfires, even moderate rainfall caused floods, increased soil erosion, and reduced water quality drastically. Natural risk analyses mostly focus on single types of events in isolation. However, this hazard cascade shows that, especially in the face of ongoing climate change, scientists and decision makers need to consider events not just by themselves, but connected with each other.

Past Variance and Future Projections of the Environmental Conditions Driving Western US Summertime Wildfire Burn Area	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						wildfire; burn; area; west; climate; change	WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; UNITED-STATES; AIR-QUALITY; FOREST-FIRE; CLIMATE; SMOKE; CARBON; MODEL; OZONE; EMISSIONS	Increases in vapor pressure deficit (VPD) have been hypothesized as the primary driver of future fire changes. The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models agree that western U.S. surface temperatures and associated dryness of air as defined by the VPD will increase in the 21st century for Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. However, we find that averaged over seasonal and regional scales, other environmental variables demonstrated to be relevant to flammability, moisture abundances, and aridity-such as precipitation, evaporation, relative humidity, root zone soil moisture, and wind speed-can be used to explain observed variance in wildfire burn area as well or better than VPD. However, the magnitude and sign of the change of these variables in the 21st century are less certain than the predicted changes in VPD. Our work demonstrates that when objectively selecting environmental variables to maximize predictive skill of linear regressions (minimize square error on unseen data) VPD is not always selected and when it is not, the magnitude of future increases in burn area becomes less certain. Hence, this work shows that future burn area predictions are sensitive to what environmental predictors are chosen to drive burn area.

A heatwave is detected when the daily maximum temperature exceeds the 90th percentile threshold at each grid for at least three consecutive days. Three characteristics describing the frequency, duration, and amplitude of heatwaves are examined, including the sum of heatwave days per year (HWF) satisfying the heatwave definition, the length of the longest yearly heatwave event (HWD), and the hottest amplitude of the hottest yearly heatwave event (HWA). Results indicate that increased global warming is associated with substantial changes in heatwave characteristics over Southeast Asia, with more frequent heatwaves, longer heatwave duration, and higher extreme temperatures. The increase in HWA has a linear growth against global warming levels with distinct regional differences between the Maritime Continent and the Indochina Peninsula due to their different heat content of lower atmospheric boundaries. In contrast, those in HWF and HWD have nonlinear growth characteristics. The projected warmer future tends to be associated with a higher risk ratio value with the occurrence of rarer extreme heatwaves relative to the current climate. These results reiterate the potential risks of extreme regional heatwaves if global warming is unrestricted.

However, we do not know well how the functioning of different types of grassland ecosystems is associated with variation in temperature and precipitation. Here, we used long-term field measurements to examine how climatic changes between the 1980s and the 2010s (i.e., growing season temperature, precipitation, habitat moisture index, solar radiation, and sunshine duration) have affected aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) for all major grassland types in northern China. We found that ANPP consistently declined over the 30-year period across all types of grassland, on average by about 6.1%. Warming, associated with increased solar radiation and, hence, soil temperature, was the primary factor driving the decrease of ANPP. We further show that ANPP was more sensitive to climate change in alpine and lowland grasslands than in temperate grasslands. Together, our findings indicate that climate warming consistently reduces plant productivity of different types of grassland ecosystems, and emphasize the importance of soil temperature in driving the decline in grassland productivity under climate change.

Forecasting the Frequency and Magnitude of Postfire Debris Flows Across Southern California	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						burn severity; debris flow; rainfall intensity; wildfire	INTENSITY-DURATION THRESHOLDS; ANTHROPOGENIC CLIMATE-CHANGE; EARTHQUAKE RUPTURE FORECAST; CONVECTIVE PRECIPITATION; EXTREME PRECIPITATION; TRANSVERSE RANGES; FIRE SEVERITY; WILDFIRE; INCREASE; IMPACT	Southern California has a long history of damaging debris flows after wildfire. Despite recurrent loss, forecasts of the frequency and magnitude of postfire debris flows are not available for the region like they are for earthquakes. Instead, debris flow hazards are typically assessed in a reactive manner after wildfires. Such assessments are crucial for evaluating debris flow risk by postfire emergency response teams; however, time between the fire and first rainstorm is often insufficient to fully develop and implement effective emergency response plans like those in place for earthquakes. Here, we use both historical distributions of fire and precipitation frequency and empirical models of postfire debris flow likelihood and volume to map the expected frequency and magnitude of postfire debris flows across southern California. We find that at least small debris flows can be expected almost every year, while major debris flows capable of damaging 40 or more structures have a recurrence interval between 10 and 13 years, a return interval that is comparable to a magnitude 6.7 earthquake. A sensitivity analysis to possible future changes in current fire and precipitation regimes indicates that debris flow activity in southern California is more sensitive to increases in precipitation intensity than increases in fire frequency and severity. Projected increases in rainfall intensity of 18% result in an overall 110% increase in the probability of major debris flows. Our results, in combination with an assessment of exposure, can be used to prioritize watersheds for further analysis and possible prefire mitigation.

Risky Development: Increasing Exposure to Natural Hazards in the United States	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						natural hazards; exposure; risk; Zillow; vulnerability	SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; LAND-COVER; FLOOD RISK; LOSSES; SIZE; INTENSITY; WILDFIRES; IMPACTS; MODEL	Losses from natural hazards are escalating dramatically, with more properties and critical infrastructure affected each year. Although the magnitude, intensity, and/or frequency of certain hazards has increased, development contributes to this unsustainable trend, as disasters emerge when natural disturbances meet vulnerable assets and populations. To diagnose development patterns leading to increased exposure in the conterminous United States (CONUS), we identified earthquake, flood, hurricane, tornado, and wildfire hazard hotspots, and overlaid them with land use information from the Historical Settlement Data Compilation data set. Our results show that 57% of structures (homes, schools, hospitals, office buildings, etc.) are located in hazard hotspots, which represent only a third of CONUS area, and similar to 1.5 million buildings lie in hotspots for two or more hazards. These critical levels of exposure are the legacy of decades of sustained growth and point to our inability, lack of knowledge, or unwillingness to limit development in hazardous zones. Development in these areas is still growing more rapidly than the baseline rates for the nation, portending larger future losses even if the effects of climate change are not considered.

Intensifying Australian Heatwave Trends and Their Sensitivity to Observational Data	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						Australia; extreme events; heatwaves	IMPACT; HEALTH; WAVES; MELBOURNE; VARIABILITY; FREQUENT; SUMMER; LONGER	Heatwaves are an accustomed extreme event of the Australian climate, which can cause catastrophic impacts on human health, agriculture, and urban and natural systems. We have analyzed the trends in Australia-wide heatwave metrics (frequency, duration, intensity, number, cumulative magnitude, timing, and season duration) across 69 extended summer seasons (i.e., from November-1951 to March-2020). Our findings not only emphasize that heatwaves are becoming hotter, longer, and more frequent, but also signify that they are occurring with excess heat, commencing much earlier, and expanding their season over many parts of Australia in recent decades. The Australian heatwave trends have strengthened since last observed Australian study was conducted. We also investigated the heatwave and severe heatwave trends at a local city-scale using three different observational products (AWAP and SILO gridded datasets and ACORN_SATV2 station data) over selected time periods (1911-2019, 1911-1964, and 1965-2019). Results suggest that heatwave trends are noticeably different amongst the three datasets. However, the results highlight that the severe heatwave cumulative magnitude and their season duration have been increasing significantly in recent decades over Australia's southern coastal cities (like Melbourne and Adelaide). The climatological mean of the most heatwave and severe heatwave metrics is substantially higher in recent decades compared to earlier periods across all the cities considered. The findings of our study have significant implications for the development of advanced heatwave planning and adaptation strategies.	[Reddy, P.

Reduced Complexity Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2: Synthesizing Earth System Knowledge for Probabilistic Climate Projections	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						climate; model intercomparison; probabilistic projections; RCMIP; reduced complexity climate model	IMPULSE-RESPONSE; ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN; DECISION-MAKING; EMPIRICAL-MODEL; GLOBAL CLIMATE; TEMPERATURE; EMISSIONS; UNCERTAINTIES; CONSTRAINTS; SENSITIVITY	Over the last decades, climate science has evolved rapidly across multiple expert domains. Our best tools to capture state-of-the-art knowledge in an internally self-consistent modeling framework are the increasingly complex fully coupled Earth System Models (ESMs). However, computational limitations and the structural rigidity of ESMs mean that the full range of uncertainties across multiple domains are difficult to capture with ESMs alone. The tools of choice are instead more computationally efficient reduced complexity models (RCMs), which are structurally flexible and can span the response dynamics across a range of domain-specific models and ESM experiments. Here we present Phase 2 of the Reduced Complexity Model Intercomparison Project (RCMIP Phase 2), the first comprehensive intercomparison of RCMs that are probabilistically calibrated with key benchmark ranges from specialized research communities. Unsurprisingly, but crucially, we find that models which have been constrained to reflect the key benchmarks better reflect the key benchmarks. Under the low-emissions SSP1-1.9 scenario, across the RCMs, median peak warming projections range from 1.3 to 1.7 degrees C (relative to 1850-1900, using an observationally based historical warming estimate of 0.8 degrees C between 1850-1900 and 1995-2014). Further developing methodologies to constrain these projection uncertainties seems paramount given the international community's goal to contain warming to below 1.5 degrees C above preindustrial in the long-term. Our findings suggest that users of RCMs should carefully evaluate their RCM, specifically its skill against key benchmarks and consider the need to include projections benchmarks either from ESM results or other assessments to reduce divergence in future projections.

It has been suggested that this phenomenon, commonly referred to as Arctic amplification, and its peak in boreal fall and winter result primarily from the lapse-rate feedback, which is associated with the vertical structure of tropospheric warming, rather than from the sea-ice albedo feedback, which operates mainly in summer. However, future climate model projections show consistently that an overall reduction of sea-ice in the Arctic region leads to a gradual weakening of Arctic amplification, thereby implying a key role for sea-ice albedo feedback. To resolve this apparent contradiction, we conduct a comprehensive analysis using atmosphere/ocean reanalysis data sets and a variety of climate model simulations. We show that the Arctic Ocean acts as a heat capacitor, storing anomalous heat resulting from the sea-ice loss during summer, which then gets released back into the atmosphere during fall and winter. Strong air-sea heat fluxes in fall/winter in sea-ice retreat regions in conjunction with a stably stratified lower troposphere lead to a surface-intensified warming/moistening, augmenting longwave feedback processes to further enhance the warming. The cold-season surface-intensified warming/moistening is found to virtually disappear if ocean-atmosphere-sea ice interactions are suppressed, demonstrating the importance of ice insulation effect and ocean heat uptake/release. These results strongly suggest that the warm-season ocean heat recharge and cold-season heat discharge link and integrate the warm and cold season feedbacks, and thereby effectively explain the predominance of the Arctic amplification in fall and winter.

However, such effects have not been well understood, particularly over rainfed croplands, partly because of the poor representation of green water in associated assessments. In this study, we develop an integrated agricultural water scarcity index (WSIag) that incorporates blue and green water components to examine the agricultural water scarcity in the baseline (1981-2005) and future (2026-2050) periods under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)2.6 and RCP6.0 scenarios. Results show that similar to 3.8 million km(2) (similar to 39% of total) croplands experienced water scarcity in the baseline period and it would expand by more than 3% in the future. Under the two scenarios, WSIag projections are similar overall and are higher than that under the baseline in 83%-84% of global total croplands. Differences are found between the scenarios in Amazonia, Southern Africa, and South Asia. The increases in future WSIag are dominated by the decreased water availability in similar to 60% of total croplands and similar to 24% of which is dominated by the increased crop water requirement. Changes in green water availability have a significant contribution to changes in WSIag in 16% of global croplands, mostly in arid/semiarid regions (e.g., the South edge of the Sahel, Southern Africa, Northeast China, and Central America). This implies the important role of green water management for agriculture in these regions.

Using a wide range of sea-level rise (SLR) scenarios, socioeconomic pathways and discount rate assumptions, 21st century coastal migration is assessed at global scale assuming local cost-benefit optimal protection decisions for about 12,000 coastal segments with homogeneous coastal and socioeconomic characteristics. Costs considered include investment and maintenance cost for protection, migration cost in the case of no protection, and expected annual damage to assets by extreme sea-level events that over-top existing protection. Robust decisions in favor of protection over all scenarios are found for about 3% of the global coastline, covering 78% of global coastal population and 92% of global coastal floodplain assets. For the remaining 97% of global coastline cumulative 21st century land loss ranges from 60,000 to 415,000 km(2) and coastal migration ranges from 17 to 72 million people. Big countries with long uninhabited coastlines suffer the biggest land losses. In absolute terms big countries in South and South-east Asia account for the highest coastal migration, while in relative terms small island nations suffer most. Global cost of 21st century SLR can be lowered by factor two to four if local cost-benefit decisions also consider, next to protection, coastal migration as an adaptation option.

The simultaneous increases in temperature and population will exacerbate the population exposure to future HWs. Here we estimate the future population exposure to daytime and nighttime HWs in SA using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) models under four Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) during 2061-2100, relative to 1975-2014. The results show that the projected frequency and spatial extent of the daytime (nighttime) HWs will be higher under scenario SSP5-8.5, followed by SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP1-2.6 (SSP5-8.5, followed by SSP3-7.0, SSP2-4.5, and SSP1-2.6), relative to the historical period. The approach presented here allows decomposing the effects of climate change and future population on the overall exposure. The results reveal that the compounding effects of projected trends in population and HWs will significantly escalate the population exposure to HWs. Under the selected SSPs, the total population exposure to daytime and nighttime HWs ranges from 185 to 492 and 204-555 million people-event, respectively, with the maximum exposure occurring in the Indo-Gigantic Plain. The wide range of exposed populations highlights the sensitivity of the overall exposure to our future socioeconomic pathway decisions, emphasizing the importance of curbing anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and adopting sustainable urban planning solutions to minimize the potential socioeconomic and health impacts of HWs.

J	Wei, YQ; Lu, HY; Wang, JN; Wang, XF; Sun, J				Wei, Yanqiang; Lu, Haiyan; Wang, Jinniu; Wang, Xufeng; Sun, Jian			Dual Influence of Climate Change and Anthropogenic Activities on the Spatiotemporal Vegetation Dynamics Over the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau From 1981 to 2015	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						vegetation dynamics; anthropogenic activities; climate change; Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau	INDUCED LAND DEGRADATION; PHOTOSYNTHETIC TRENDS; ALPINE GRASSLAND; NORTH-AMERICA; VARIABILITY; PERMAFROST; IMPACT; CHINA; ELEVATION; GLACIER	Climate change and human activities have already caused degradation in a large fraction of vegetation on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). Many studies report that climate variability instead of overgrazing has been the primary cause for large-scale vegetation cover changes on the QTP, for example, Lehnert et al., 2016, . However, it remains unclear how human activities (mainly livestock grazing) regulate vegetation dynamics under climate change. This paper takes the AVHRR/GIMMS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as an indicator to analyze the growth status of vegetation zones in the QTP, which has highly sensitive to climate change. The spatiotemporal dynamics of vegetation growth between 1981 and 2015 were analyzed. The dual effects of climate change and human activities were examined by correlation analyses of data from 87 meteorological stations and economic statistical data of the QTP. Results show that: (a) The vegetation in central and southwestern QTP with high altitudes was improving due to the warm-humid climate trend. An increase in temperature and a reduction in the harsh frigid climate at high altitudes due to global warming has resulted in expansions of the vegetated areas, with the NDVI showing a concordant increase. (b) The degraded areas were mainly confined to the northern and eastern QTP, which have high human and livestock population densities. In comparison to gently changing climate regimes, anthropogenic activities such as chronic concentration of population and livestock in the valleys with a less harsh climate exerts a much stronger pressure on vegetation. The study indicates that the anthropogenic pressures are much more intensive than the impact of climate change and are critical for the conservation and sustainable management of the QTP vegetation.

This commentary lays out core definitions and concepts, identifies MSD science questions in the context of the current state of knowledge, and describes ongoing activities to expand capacities for open science, leverage revolutions in data and computing, and grow and diversify the MSD workforce. Central to our vision is the ambition of advancing the next generation of complex adaptive human-Earth systems science to better address interconnected risks, increase resilience, and improve sustainability. This will require convergent research and the integration of ideas and methods from multiple disciplines. Understanding the tradeoffs, synergies, and complexities that exist in coupled human-Earth systems is particularly important in the context of energy transitions and increased future shocks.

Uncertainty and Bias in Global to Regional Scale Assessments of Current and Future Coastal Flood Risk	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						coastal flooding; sea-level rise; extreme events; uncertainty; storm surge; waves	SEA-LEVEL RISE; WAVE CLIMATE; TROPICAL CYCLONES; STORM-SURGE; WATER-LEVEL; MEDITERRANEAN SEA; PROJECTED CHANGES; WIND; MODEL; TIDE	This study provides a literature-based comparative assessment of uncertainties and biases in global to world-regional scale assessments of current and future coastal flood risks, considering mean and extreme sea-level hazards, the propagation of these into the floodplain, people and coastal assets exposed, and their vulnerability. Globally, by far the largest bias is introduced by not considering human adaptation, which can lead to an overestimation of coastal flood risk in 2100 by up to factor 1300. But even when considering adaptation, uncertainties in how coastal societies will adapt to sea-level rise dominate with a factor of up to 27 all other uncertainties. Other large uncertainties that have been quantified globally are associated with socio-economic development (factors 2.3-5.8), digital elevation data (factors 1.2-3.8), ice sheet models (factor 1.6-3.8) and greenhouse gas emissions (factors 1.6-2.1). Local uncertainties that stand out but have not been quantified globally, relate to depth-damage functions, defense failure mechanisms, surge and wave heights in areas affected by tropical cyclones (in particular for large return periods), as well as nearshore interactions between mean sea-levels, storm surges, tides and waves. Advancing the state-of-the-art requires analyzing and reporting more comprehensively on underlying uncertainties, including those in data, methods and adaptation scenarios. Epistemic uncertainties in digital elevation, coastal protection levels and depth-damage functions would be best reduced through open community-based efforts, in which many scholars work together in collecting and validating these data.

Here, we examined how dam properties control different facets of flow alteration across the coterminous United States (CONUS), and compared alteration trends between dam-affected and reference stream gages. We quantified departures from the natural flow regime using 730 stations with long-term daily discharge data. Dam size and purpose explained high variation in flow alteration, and alteration was particularly severe in water-stressed regions. Importantly, regulation of river flows by dams often dampened climate-driven alteration (48% of the flow metrics), particularly in watersheds with positive flow trends; while worsening climatic impacts in other cases (44%), or even having dual effects (8%). Our results show that dam and climate impacts on streamflow need to be assessed jointly, and based on a diverse range of flow regime facets (e.g., event magnitude and duration, frequency, and timing) instead of mean annual flows only. By pairing the USGS streamflow records available from upstream and downstream of 209 dams across the CONUS, we advance the notion that dams amplify flow alteration, but also ameliorate some flow alteration metrics. Understanding such potential and limitations is important in light of climate non-stationarity and a new wave of damming in developing economies, and will be key to further advancing environmental flow science into the future.

Cloud-Nucleating Particles Over the Southern Ocean in a Changing Climate	EARTHS FUTURE			English	Article						aerosol particles; Antarctica; climate change; clouds; phytoplankton; Southern Ocean	MARINE BOUNDARY-LAYER; SEA SPRAY AEROSOL; CONDENSATION NUCLEI; ATMOSPHERIC PARTICLES; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; DIMETHYL-SULFIDE; MIXED-PHASE; ICE; PHYTOPLANKTON; SULFUR	Stratocumulus clouds over the Southern Ocean have fewer droplets and are more likely to exist in the predominately supercooled phase than clouds at similar temperatures over northern oceans. One likely reason is that this region has few continental and anthropogenic sources of cloud-nucleating particles that can form droplets and ice. In this work, we present an overview of aerosol particle types over the Southern Ocean, including new measurements made below, in and above clouds in this region. These measurements and others indicate that biogenic sulfur-based particles >0.1 mu m diameter contribute the majority of cloud condensation nuclei number concentrations in summer. Ice nucleating particles tend to have more organic components, likely from sea-spray. Both types of cloud nucleating particles may increase in a warming climate likely to have less sea ice, more phytoplankton activity, and stronger winds over the Southern Ocean near Antarctica. Taken together, clouds over the Southern Ocean may become more reflective and partially counter the region's expected albedo decrease due to diminishing sea ice. However, detailed modeling studies are needed to test this hypothesis due to the complexity of ocean-cloud-climate feedbacks in the region.

However, global warming may alter the drought propagation features, which are not fully understood. This study aims to investigate changes in meteorological and hydrological drought conditions, especially their propagation features in 1.5-3.0 degrees C warmer climates for 8,655 watersheds globally. First, the three-month scale standardized precipitation index and the standardized runoff index are calculated based on the precipitation simulated by the 15 global climate models and the runoff simulated by the four hydrological models, respectively. Drought events are then identified using the run theory, followed by the calculation of drought propagation features (i.e., pooling, lag, and lengthening) for matched meteorological and hydrological droughts. As a result, both meteorological and hydrological drought conditions (i.e., duration and severity) would relieve in warmer climates due to increased precipitation for regions excluding Western North America, South America, the Mediterranean, Southern Africa, East Asia, and Australia. However, the drought conditions would be more severe during drought propagation from meteorological to hydrological droughts over most regions. During drought propagation, the worsening drought conditions over half of the regions would be more serious first and then relieved with the rising temperature. These results indicate that efforts to slow down global warming can suppress the deterioration of drought conditions in the propagation.
