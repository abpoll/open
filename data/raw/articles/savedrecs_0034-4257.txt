The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) lidar instrument onboard the International Space Station has been collecting unique data on vegetation structure since April 2019. Here, we employed global Landsat analysis-ready data to extrapolate GEDI footprint-level forest canopy height measurements, creating a 30 m spatial resolution global forest canopy height map for the year 2019. The global forest height map was compared to the GEDI validation data (RMSE = 6.6 m; MAE = 4.45 m, R-2 = 0.62) and available airborne lidar data (RMSE = 9.07 m; MAE = 6.36 m, R-2 = 0.61). The demonstrated integration of GEDI data with time-series optical imagery is expected to enable multidecadal historic analysis and operational forward monitoring of forest height and its dynamics. Such capability is important to support global climate and sustainable development initiatives.

Particular challenges exist in China where tidal flats are changing rapidly along with accelerated economic development in coastal regions. The unique and important ecosystem functions and services that tidal flats provide in coastal regions warrant the necessary of mapping such a particular land cover type in high precision and accuracy. Existing national tidal flat maps of China, which were derived from the 30-m resolution Landsat imagery and auxiliary data, are insufficient to support practical management efforts. In this study, in order to produce an accurate tidal flat map with finer spatial resolution, we employed 28,367 scenes of time series Sentinel-2 images acquired in 2019 and 2020 along the entire coastal line of China. The short revisit cycle (2-5 days) of the Sentinel-2 improved the opportunities of obtaining the highest and lowest tide images, and the finer spatial resolution (10-m) enhanced the capacity of precision tidal flat extraction. A rapid, robust, and automated tidal flat mapping approach is essential to large-scale applications. In this study, we developed an approach by integrating the maximum spectral index composite (MSIC) and the Otsu algorithm (OA), and so named MSIC-OA. By GEE platform, we automated the execution of MSIC-OA to Sentinel-2 images, and produced an up-to-date 10-m spatial resolution tidal flat map of China (China_Tidal Flat, CTF). Validated by massive field-based observations and selected edge-points, the CTF map achieved an overall accuracy of 95% and the F1 score of 0.93. As we calculated, the total area of tidal flats in China was 858,784 ha, and Jiangsu Province accounted the largest proportion (24%) of the national total. This study is the first attempt to delineate tidal flats automatically at a 10-m spatial resolution. The CTF map can provide essential information for management of coastal ecosystems and facilitate the implementations of coastal and marine related Sustainable Development Goals.

J	Liu, AB; Cheng, X; Chen, ZQ				Liu, Aobo; Cheng, Xiao; Chen, Zhuoqi			Performance evaluation of GEDI and ICESat-2 laser altimeter data for terrain and canopy height retrievals	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						ICESat-2; GEDI; Canopy height; Elevation; Accuracy assessment	BOREAL FOREST; LIDAR; LAND; REQUIREMENTS; UNCERTAINTY; CLOUD	With the advent of the next generation of space-based laser altimeters, ICESat-2 and GEDI, we are entering an exciting era of active remote sensing of forests that offers unprecedented opportunities for the observation of forest structure. Consistent comparisons of the accuracy of terrain and canopy height retrievals for these two missions are essential for continued improvement and further application. Because the time interval between the spaceborne products and validation data may introduce additional errors, we validate the newly released GEDI L2A product (version 2) and the ICESat-2 ATL08 product (version 4) using high-resolution, locally calibrated airborne lidar products acquired in the same year (2019) as the reference datasets. In addition, our study area contains 40 sites located in the U.S. mainland, Alaska, and Hawaii that encompass a variety of eco-climatic zones and vegetation cover types; thus, it avoids the uncertainties associated with small sample sizes and restricted spatial coverage. The results show that ICESat-2 and GEDI yield reasonable estimates of terrain height, with root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of 2.24 and 4.03 m for mid and low latitudes, respectively, and 0.98 m for high latitudes (ICESat-2 only). ICESat-2 outperforms GEDI across the board for terrain height retrieval, although they both have better accuracy than existing SRTM and GMTED DEM products. Analyses of the error factors suggest that steep slopes (>30 degrees) present the greatest challenge for both GEDI and ICESat-2; in addition, tall (>20 m) and dense canopies (>90%) forest ecosystems also reduce the accuracy of the terrain height estimates. When ICESat2 and GEDI data are used for canopy height retrieval, the use of only strong/power beam data acquired at night is recommended, as the overall RMSEs decrease from 7.21 and 5.02 m to 3.93 and 3.56 m, respectively, compared to using all data regardless of daytime and beam strength. GEDI outperforms ICESat-2 across the board for canopy height retrieval, as ICESat-2 has a larger potential bias for almost all forest types and cover conditions. ICESat-2 tends to overestimate the canopy height of dwarf shrublands and underestimate the canopy height of forest, and there is a gradual downward shift in the distribution of residuals with increasing canopy height. Overall, ICESat-2 with photon counting technology and GEDI with full waveform technology each represent the state of the art in spaceborne laser altimeters for terrain and canopy height retrieval. Combined, these two missions can take advantage of the unique strengths of each instrument.

Multi-sensor remote sensing for drought characterization: current status, opportunities and a roadmap for the future	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Data fusion; Drought; Drought impact; Drought monitoring; Ecohydrology; Multi-sensor satellite; Regional scale drought	INDUCED CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; LAND-SURFACE-TEMPERATURE; LEAF-AREA INDEX; MONITORING AGRICULTURAL DROUGHT; E BRIGHTNESS TEMPERATURES; INDUCED TREE MORTALITY; NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION; SNOW WATER EQUIVALENT; FUEL MOISTURE-CONTENT; LONG-TERM DROUGHT	Satellite based remote sensing offers one of the few approaches able to monitor the spatial and temporal development of regional to continental scale droughts. A unique element of remote sensing platforms is their multi-sensor capability, which enhances the capacity for characterizing drought from a variety of perspectives. Such aspects include monitoring drought influences on vegetation and hydrological responses, as well as assessing sectoral impacts (e.g., agriculture). With advances in remote sensing systems along with an increasing range of platforms available for analysis, this contribution provides a timely and systematic review of multi sensor remote sensing drought studies, with a particular focus on drought related datasets, drought related phenomena and mechanisms, and drought modeling. To explore this topic, we first present a comprehensive summary of large-scale remote sensing datasets that can be used for multi-sensor drought studies. We then review the role of multi-sensor remote sensing for exploring key drought related phenomena and mechanisms, including vegetation responses to drought, land-atmospheric feedbacks during drought, drought-induced tree mortality, drought-related ecosystem fires, post-drought recovery and legacy effects, flash drought, as well as drought trends under climate change. A summary of recent modeling advances towards developing integrated multi-sensor remote sensing drought indices is also provided. We conclude that leveraging multi-sensor remote sensing provides unique benefits for regional to global drought studies, particularly in: 1) revealing the complex drought impact mechanisms on ecosystem components; 2) providing continuous long-term drought related information at large scales; 3) presenting real-time drought information with high spatiotemporal resolution; 4) providing multiple lines of evidence of drought monitoring to improve modeling and prediction robustness; and 5) improving the accuracy of drought monitoring and assessment efforts. We specifically highlight that more mechanism-oriented drought studies that leverage a combination of sensors and techniques (e.g., optical, microwave, hyperspectral, LiDAR, and constellations) across a range of spatiotemporal scales are needed in order to progress and advance our understanding, characterization and description of drought in the future.

Soil moisture products provided by passive microwave remote sensing possess coarse spatial resolutions ranging from 25 to 50 km, unable to reflect large spatial heterogeneity in soil moisture caused by complex interactions among meteorological forcing, land cover, and topography. Meanwhile, active microwave remote sensing can provide higher spatial resolution than passive sensors that may reach 1 km but with lower temporal resolution of 6-12 days (e.g., Sentinel-1). Better water resources management, particularly for the agricultural sector, requires spatiotemporally continuous soil moisture estimates at the field scale (e.g., 30 m x 30 m) to reflect its high spatiotemporal variability across heterogeneous land surfaces. In this study, both data fusion and random forest models along with a range of remote sensing, reanalysis, and in situ data were jointly used to generate spatiotemporally continuous surface soil moisture (SSM) at 30 m x 30 m. First, both daily normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and surface albedo at 30 m x 30 m were generated by fusing reflectance products of the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat. Second, China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS, 0.0625 degrees x 0.0625 degrees) land surface temperature (LST) was fused with both MODIS LST and Landsat LST to generate spatially complete LST maps (at 11 a.m. local solar time for each day) at 30 m x 30 m. Last, random forest models were developed to generate spatiotemporally continuous SSM of 30 m x 30 m using the fused variables at fine spatial resolution (e. g., NDVI, surface albedo, and LST), SSM background fields, and ancillary variables such as precipitation and soil texture as the model inputs. Compared with original SSM of the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) Version 4.4 SSM, Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Level-4 SSM, and CLDAS SSM, the downscaled SSM using these products as background fields was improved significantly in terms of accuracy and spatial distribution. Moreover, the integration of multiple SSM background fields improved the performance of the downscaled SSM significantly in terms of spatiotemporal consistency and accuracy compared with that using a single SSM background field. Overall, the downscaled SMAP_L4 + CLDAS SSM showed the best performance at four sites (i.e., Weishan, Huailai, Hujiatan, and Paihuai) out of seven sites on the North China Plain with R, bias, MAE, RMSE, and ubRMSE ranging from 0.70-0.84, -0.034-0.012 cm (3)/cm(3), 0.025-0.044 cm(3)/cm(3), 0.031-0.050 cm(3)/cm(3), and 0.022-0.042 cm(3)/cm(3), respectively. The proposed framework maximizes the potential of data fusion, random forest models, and in situ data in deriving spatiotemporally continuous SSM estimates at 30 m x 30 m, which should be valuable for water resources management at the field scale.

Linking maximum and accumulation perspectives	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						LST; Cooling intensity; Cooling gradient; Cooling capacity bundle; Shenzhen City		Urban parks can significantly alleviate the urban heat island, an ecological issue caused by urbanization. Clarifying urban park cooling effect can improve climate change adaptability and urban sustainability. However, park cooling effects were mainly explored in maximum perspective in previous studies, without considering the cumulative impact resulting from spatial continuity. Therefore, focusing on 24 urban parks in the main city zone of Shenzhen, China, such cumulative indexes as park cooling intensity and park cooling gradient, were proposed in this study and integrated with maximum indexes of park cooling area and park cooling efficiency, so as to explore park cooling effects comprehensively. The results showed that the park areas and cold spot areas of land surface temperature overlapped spatially by 64.40%. The partial correlation analysis showed that, park perimeter, area and shape index were significantly and positively correlated with park cooling area, with significantly negative correlation for park cooling efficiency. The vegetation index was significantly and positively correlated with park cooling intensity and park cooling gradient, and the impact of water body area ratio to all the four park cooling indexes was not significant. Then cooling effects of 24 urban parks were classified into four cooling capacity bundles, which showed that parks designed to serve different social functions behaved different cooling effects. The cooling effect of comprehensive parks was more efficient, with the same low value of all four cooling indexes for theme parks, high cooling intensity and cooling gradient for small ecological parks, and the highest cooling area for large ecological parks. This study proposed a comprehensive approach to measuring park cooling effects with both maximum and accumulation perspectives, which can guide urban park planning and design to maximize the ecological benefits.

High-resolution, national-scale maps of agricultural land are needed to develop strategies for future sustainable agriculture. However, the characterization of agricultural land cover over large areas and for multiple years remains challenging due to the locally diverse and temporally variable characteristics of cultivated land. We here propose a workflow for generating national agricultural land cover maps on a yearly basis that accounts for varying environmental conditions. We tested the approach by mapping 24 agricultural land cover classes in Germany for the three years 2017, 2018, and 2019, in which the meteorological conditions strongly differed. We used a random forest classifier and dense time series data from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 in combination with monthly Sentinel-1 composites and environmental data and evaluated the relative importance of optical, radar, and environmental data. Our results show high overall accuracy and plausible class accuracies for the most dominant crop types across different years despite the strong inter-annual meteorological variability and the presence of drought and nondrought years. The maps show high spatial consistency and good delineation of field parcels. Combining optical, SAR, and environmental data increased overall accuracies by 6% to 10% compared to single sensor approaches, in which optical data outperformed SAR. Overall accuracy ranged between 78% and 80%, and the mapped areas aligned well with agricultural statistics at the regional and national level. Based on the multi-year dataset we mapped major crop sequences of cereals and leaf crops. Most crop sequences were dominated by winter cereals followed by summer cereals. Monocultures of summer cereals were mainly revealed in the Northwest of Germany. We showcased that high spatial and thematic detail in combination with annual mapping will stimulate research on crop cycles and studies to assess the impact of environmental policies on management decisions. Our results demonstrate the capabilities of integrated optical time series and SAR data in combination with variables describing local and seasonal environmental conditions for annual large-area crop type mapping.

Fifty years of Landsat science and impacts	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Earth observation; Land cover; Land use; Climate change; Human footprint; Open data; Satellite	CONTERMINOUS UNITED-STATES; DIFFERENCE VEGETATION INDEX; URBAN HEAT-ISLAND; TIME-SERIES; SURFACE REFLECTANCE; FOREST DISTURBANCE; THEMATIC MAPPER; PROTECTED AREAS; SATELLITE DATA; COVER CHANGE	Since 1972, the Landsat program has been continually monitoring the Earth, to now provide 50 years of digital, multispectral, medium spatial resolution observations. Over this time, Landsat data were crucial for many scientific and technical advances. Prior to the Landsat program, detailed, synoptic depictions of the Earth's surface were rare, and the ability to acquire and work with large datasets was limited. The early years of the Landsat program delivered a series of technological breakthroughs, pioneering new methods, and demonstrating the ability and capacity of digital satellite imagery, creating a template for other global Earth observation missions and programs. Innovations driven by the Landsat program have paved the way for subsequent science, application, and policy support activities. The economic and scientific value of the knowledge gained through the Landsat program has been long recognized, and despite periods of funding uncertainty, has resulted in the program's 50 years of continuity, as well as substantive and ongoing improvements to payload and mission performance. Free and open access to Landsat data, enacted in 2008, was unprecedented for medium spatial resolution Earth observation data and substantially increased usage and led to a proliferation of science and application opportunities. Here, we highlight key developments over the past 50 years of the Landsat program that have influenced and changed our scientific understanding of the Earth system. Major scientific and programmatic impacts have been realized in the areas of agricultural crop mapping and water use, climate change drivers and impacts, ecosystems and land cover monitoring, and mapping the changing human footprint. The introduction of Landsat collection processing, coupled with the free and open data policy, facilitated a transition in Landsat data usage away from single images and towards time series analyses over large areas and has fostered the widespread use of science-grade data. The launch of Landsat-9 on September 27, 2021, and the advanced planning of its successor mission, Landsat-Next, underscore the sustained institutional support for the program. Such support and commitment to continuity is recognition of both the historic impact the program, and the future potential to build upon Landsat's remarkable 50-year legacy.

Accurate and timely estimation of corn yield is therefore essential for commodity trading and global food security. Recently, several deep learning models have been explored for corn yield forecasting. Despite success, most existing models only provide yield estimations without quantifying the uncertainty associated with the predictions. Also, the traditional deep learning approaches typically require a large training set and are easily prone to overfitting when the number of samples in the training set is relatively small. To address these limitations, in this study, we developed a county-level corn yield prediction model based on Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) using multiple data sources that are publicly available, including time-series satellite products, sequential climate observations, soil property maps, and historical corn yield records. Using preceding years since 2001 for model training, the developed BNN model achieved an average coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.77 for late-season prediction across the U.S. Corn Belt in testing years 2010-2019, and outperformed five other state-of-the-art machine learning models. Detailed evaluation in three representative testing years demonstrated that the proposed BNN model could accurately estimate corn yield not only in normal years but also in abnormal years when extreme weather events happened. Moreover, the timeliness of the prediction was evaluated within the growing season with an R-2 similar to 0.75 achieved by middle August, which is about 2 months before the harvest. We also assessed the predictive uncertainty, and more than 84% of the observed yield records were successfully enveloped in the 95% confidence interval of the predictive yield distribution. Our results also showed that the uncertainty level decreased steadily as time proceeded and stabilized around early August. Uncertainties in yield prediction were mainly induced by the observation noise and also related to the inter-annual and seasonal variabilities of environmental stress such as heat and water stress. This paper provides a robust framework for the within-season prediction of crop yield and highlights the need to obtain a deeper understanding of the effects of environmental stress on agricultural productivity and crop yield estimation.

The Copernicus program, and Sentinel-1 (S1) in particular, offers the opportunity to monitor agricultural land at a continental scale and in a timely manner. However, so far the potential of S1 has not been explored at such a scale. Capitalizing on the unique LUCAS 2018 Copernicus in-situ survey, we present the first continental crop type map at 10-m spatial resolution for the EU based on S1A and S1B Synthetic Aperture Radar observations for the year 2018. Random Forest classification algorithms are tuned to detect 19 different crop types. We assess the accuracy of this EU crop map with three approaches. First, the accuracy is assessed with independent LUCAS core in-situ observations over the continent. Second, an accuracy assessment is done specifically for main crop types from farmers declarations from 6 EU member countries or regions totaling >3 M parcels and 8.21 Mha. Finally, the crop areas derived by classification are compared to the subnational (NUTS 2) area statistics reported by Eurostat. The overall accuracy for the map is reported as 80.3% when grouping main crop classes and 76% when considering all 19 crop type classes separately. Highest accuracies are obtained for rape and turnip rape with user and produced accuracies higher than 96%. The correlation between the remotely sensed estimated and Eurostat reported crop area ranges from 0.93 (potatoes) to 0.99 (rape and turnip rape). Finally, we discuss how the framework presented here can underpin the operational delivery of inseason high-resolution based crop mapping.

However, regulation is dependent on a sparse network of air quality monitoring stations and insufficient ground data. This study utilizes long-term observations of aerosols and trace gases to characterize and rank the air pollution scenarios and pollution characteristics of 80 selected cities in Pakistan. Datasets used include (1) the Aqua and Terra (AquaTerra) MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectmradiometer) Level 2 Collection 6.1 merged Dark Target and Deep Blue (DTB) aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieval products; (2) the CAMS (Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service) reanalysis PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 data; (3) the MERRA-2 (Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2) reanalysis PM2.5 data, (4) the OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) tropospheric vertical column density (TVCD) of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and VCD of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL), (5) the VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) Nighttime Lights data, (6) MODIS Collection 6 Version 2 global monthly fire location data (MCD14ML), (7) population density, (8) MODIS Level 3 Collection 6 land cover types, (9) AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) Version 3 Level 2.0 data, and (10) ground-based PM2.5 concentrations from air quality monitoring stations. Potential Source Contribution Function (PSCF) analyses were performed by integrating with ground-based PM2.5 concentrations and the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) air parcel back trajectories to identify potential pollution source areas which are responsible for extreme air pollution in Pakistan. Results show that the ranking of the top polluted cities depends on the type of pollutant considered and the metric used.For example, Jhang, Multan, and Vehari were characterized as the top three polluted cities in Pakistan when considering AquaTerra DTB AOD products; for PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 Lahore, Gujranwala, and Okara were the top three; for tropospheric NO2 VCD Lahore, Rawalpindi, and Islamabad and for PBL SO2 VCD Lahore, Mirpur, and Gujranwala. The results demonstrate that Pakistan's entire population has been exposed to high PM2.5 concentrations for many years, with a mean annual value of 54.7 mu g/m(3), over all Pakistan from 2003 to 2020.This value exceeds Pakistan's National Environmental Quality Standards (Pak-NEQS, i.e., <15 mu g/m(3) annual mean) for ambient air defined by the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) as well as the WHO Interim Target-1 (i.e., mean annual PM2.5 < 35 mu g/m(3)).The spatial analyses of the concentrations of aerosols and trace gases in terms of population density, nighttime lights, land cover types, and fire location data, and the PSCF analysis indicate that Pakistan's air quality is strongly affected by anthropogenic sources inside of Pakistan, with contributions from surrounding countries.Statistically significant positive (increasing) trends in PM1, PM2. 5, PM10, tropospheric NO2 VCD, and SO2 VCD were observed in similar to 89%, similar to 67%, similar to 48%, 91%, and similar to 88% of the Pakistani cities (80 cities), respectively.

However, effective phenology retrieval may still be hampered by significant cloud cover. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations are not restricted by weather conditions, and Sentinel-1 thus ensures more frequent observations of the land surface. However, these data have not been systematically exploited for phenology retrieval so far. In this study, we extracted crop-specific land surface phenology (LSP) from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 of major European crops (common and durum wheat, barley, maize, oats, rape and turnip rape, sugar beet, sunflower, and dry pulses) using ground-truth information from the "Copernicus module" of the Land Use/Cover Area frame statistical Survey (LUCAS) of 2018. We consistently used a single model-fit approach to retrieve LSP metrics on temporal profiles of CR (Cross Ratio, the ratio of the backscattering coefficient VH/VV from Sentinel-1) and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index from Sentinel-2). Our analysis revealed that LSP retrievals from Sentinel-1 are comparable to those of Sentinel-2, particularly for winter crops. The start of season (SOS) timings, as derived from Sentinel-1 and -2, are significantly correlated (average r of 0.78 for winter and 0.46 for summer crops). The correlation is lower for end of season retrievals (EOS, r of 0.62 and 0.34). Agreement between LSP derived from Sentinel-1 and -2 varies among crop types, ranging from r = 0.89 and mean absolute error MAE = 10 days (SOS of dry pulses) to r = 0.15 and MAE = 53 days (EOS of sugar beet). Observed deviations revealed that Sentinel-1 and -2 LSP retrievals can be complementary; for example for winter crops we found that SAR detected the start of the spring growth while multispectral data is sensitive to the vegetative growth before and during winter. To test if our results correspond reasonably to in-situ data, we compared average crop-specific LSP for Germany to average phenology from ground phenological observations of 2018 gathered from the German Meteorological Service (DWD). Our study demonstrated that both Sentinel-1 and -2 can provide relevant and at times complementary LSP information at field- and crop-level.

Satellite earth observation provides an unparalleled source of freely available data for studying dynamic coastlines through time and across large spatial extents. However, previous satellite-derived shoreline mapping approaches have been challenged by two key limitations: the medium spatial resolution of freely available satellite data, and the confounding influence of tides that can obscure longer term patterns of coastal change. In this study we present Digital Earth Australia Coastlines, a new continental dataset documenting three decades of coastal change across Australia. We combine sub-pixel waterline extraction with a new pixel-based tidal modelling method to seamlessly map almost 2 million km of tide-datum shorelines along the entire Australian coast from 1988 to 2019. Our tidally-constrained median composite approach maps the dominant annual position of the shoreline at 0 m Above Mean Sea Level each year, suppressing the short-term influence of tides and sub-annual shoreline variability. Using this robust mid-term shoreline proxy, long-term coastal change rates spanning the last three decades were accurately quantified and mapped at the continental scale. We find that 22% of Australia's non-rocky coastline has retreated or grown significantly since 1988, with 16% changing at greater than 0.5 m per year. Although trends of retreat and growth were closely balanced across the Australian continent, our results highlight significant regional variability and extreme local hotspots of coastal change. Our findings provide new insights into patterns and trends of coastal change across Australia, and highlight advantages and limitations of tide modelling and composite-based methods for extracting consistent shoreline data and long-term coastal trends from earth observation data at continental scale. Digital Earth Australia Coastlines is made available to the public as free and open interactive tools and code to support future coastal research and management across Australia, and any coastal region globally with access to free and open medium resolution satellite data.

More than 40% of QTP is covered by permafrost, yet few studies have evaluated the accuracy of SSM and RZSM products derived from microwave satellite, land surface models (LSMs) and reanalysis over that region. This study tries to address this gap by evaluating a range of satellite and reanalysis estimates of SSM and RZSM in the thawed soil overlaying permafrost in the QTP, using in-situ measurements from sixteen stations. Here, seven SSM products were evaluated: Soil Moisture Active Passive L3 (SMAP L3) and L4 (SMAP-L4), Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity in version IC (SMOS IC), Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI), Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT), and the fifth generation of the land component of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts atmospheric reanalysis (ERAS-Land). We also evaluated three RZSM products from SMAP-L4, ERA5-Land, and the Noah land surface model driven by Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS-Noah). The assessment was conducted using five statistical metrics, i. e. Pearson correlation coefficient (R), bias, slope, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE) between SSM or RZSM products and in-situ measurements. Our results showed that the ESA CCI, SMAP-L4 and SMOS-IC SSM products outperformed the other SSM products, indicated by higher correlation coefficients (R) (with a median R value of 0.63, 0.44 and 0.57, respectively) and lower ubRMSE (with a median ubRMSE value of 0.05, 0.04 and 0.07 m(3)/m(3), respectively). Yet, SSM overestimation was found for all SSM products. This could be partly attributed to ancillary data used in the retrieval (e.g. overestimation of land surface temperature for SMAP-L3) and to the fact that the products (e.g. LPRM) more easily overestimate the in-situ SSM when the soil is very dry. As expected, SMAP-L3 SSM performed better in areas with sparse vegetation than with dense vegetation covers. For RZSM products, SMAP-L4 and GLDAS-Noah (R = 0.66 and 0.44, ubRMSE = 0.03 and 0.02 m(3)/m(3), respectively) performed better than ERAS-Land (R = 0.46; ubRMSE = 0.03 m(3)/m(3)). It is also found that all RZSM products were unable to capture the variations of in-situ RZSM during the freezing/thawing period over the permafrost regions of QTP, due to large deviation for the ice-water phase change simulation and the lack of consideration for unfrozen-water migration during freezing processes in the LSMs.	[Xing, Zanpin; Zhao, Lin; Hu, Guojie; Xiao, Yao; Du, Erji; Li, Ren; Qiao, Yongping; Shi, Jianzong] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Cryosphere Res Stn Qinghai Xizang Plateau, State Key Lab Cryospher Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Xing, Zanpin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Fan, Lei; Zhao, Lin] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Geog Sci, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Fan, Lei; Ma, Mingguo] Southwest Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Chongqing Jinfo Mt Karst Ecosyst Natl Observat &, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China; [De Lannoy, Gabrielle] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium; [Frappart, Frederic] Univ Toulouse, Lab Etud Geophys & Oceanog Spatiales LEGOS, F-31400 Toulouse, France; [Frappart, Frederic] Geosci Environm Toulouse GET, F-31400 Toulouse, France; [Peng, Jian] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Remote Sensing, Permoserstr 15, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Peng, Jian] Univ Leipzig, Remote Sensing Ctr Earth Syst Res, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Li, Xiaojun; Al-Yaari, Amen; Wang, Mengjia; Liu, Xiangzhuo; Wigneron, Jean-Pierre] Univ Bordeaux, ISPA UMR1391, INRAE, Bordeaux, France; [Zeng, Jiangyuan; Zhao, Tianjie; Shi, Jiancheng; Wen, Jianguang] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Al-Yaari, Amen] Sorbonne Univ, UMR METIS 7619, Case 105,4 Pl Jussieu, Paris, France; [Yang, Kun] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Yang, Kun] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China	Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Southwest University - China; KU Leuven; Universite de Toulouse; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); Leipzig University; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Tsinghua University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, CAS	Fan, L (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Geog Sci, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.; Fan, L (corresponding author), Southwest Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Chongqing Jinfo Mt Karst Ecosyst Natl Observat &, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China.	leifan33@swu.edu.cn	Zeng, Jiangyuan/AAJ-8512-2020; Yang, Kun/G-8390-2011; Shi, Jiancheng/HIU-0908-2022; Hu, Guojie/M-5738-2019; Peng, Jian/IQT-8432-2023; Yang, Kun/ISA-1094-2023; Zhao, Lin/M-9536-2018; Li, Xiaojun/AFO-0620-2022; Al-Yaari, Amen/B-1444-2016; Yang, Wei/GWV-4107-2022; Mingguo, Ma/A-8087-2013; Wigneron, Jean-Pierre André/ABD-9939-2021; Yang, Wei/HIA-0360-2022; De Lannoy, Gabrielle/C-9101-2017	Zeng, Jiangyuan/0000-0002-5039-6774; Yang, Kun/0000-0002-0809-2371; Hu, Guojie/0000-0002-5428-0445; Peng, Jian/0000-0002-4071-0512; Yang, Kun/0000-0003-1335-3449; Zhao, Lin/0000-0003-0245-8413; Li, Xiaojun/0000-0002-3831-4852; Al-Yaari, Amen/0000-0001-7530-6088; Wigneron, Jean-Pierre André/0000-0001-5345-3618; De Lannoy, Gabrielle/0000-0002-6743-7122; Frappart, Frederic/0000-0002-4661-8274	National Natural Science Foundation of China [41931180, 42171339, 41801247, 41830648, 42071094]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) program, China [2019QZKK0201]; Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) [G0C8918N]; KU Leuven [C14/16/045]	National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) program, China; Research Foundation Flanders (FWO)(FWO); KU Leuven(KU Leuven)	This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41931180) , the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (STEP) program, China (2019QZKK0201) , and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 42171339, 41801247, 41830648, 42071094) .

While GEDI is the first space-based LIDAR explicitly optimized to measure vertical forest structure predictive of aboveground biomass, the accurate interpretation of this vast amount of waveform data across the broad range of observational and environmental conditions is challenging. Here, we present a novel supervised machine learning approach to interpret GEDI waveforms and regress canopy top height globally. We propose a probabilistic deep learning approach based on an ensemble of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) to avoid the explicit modelling of unknown effects, such as atmospheric noise. The model learns to extract robust features that generalize to unseen geographical regions and, in addition, yields reliable estimates of predictive uncertainty. Ultimately, the global canopy top height estimates produced by our model have an expected RMSE of 2.7 m with low bias.

This article describes the Copernicus Sentinel-6 mission that is designed to provide precision sea level, sea surface height, significant wave height, inland water heights and other products tailored to operational services in the ocean, climate, atmospheric and land Copernicus Services. Sentinel-6 provides enhanced continuity to the very stable time series of mean sea level measurements and ocean sea state started in 1992 by the TOPEX/Poseidon mission and follow-on Jason-1, Jason-2 and Jason-3 satellite missions. The mission is implemented through a unique international partnership with contributions from NASA, NOAA, ESA, EUMETSAT, and the European Union (EU). It includes two satellites that will fly sequentially (separated in time by 5 years). The first satellite, named Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich, launched from Vandenburg Air Force Base, USA on 21st November 2020. The satellite and payload elements are explained including required performance and their operation. The main payload is the Poseidon-4 dual frequency (C/Ku-band) nadir-pointing radar altimeter that uses an innovative interleaved mode. This enables radar data processing on two parallel chains the first provides synthetic aperture radar (SAR) processing in Ku-band to improve the received altimeter echoes through better along-track sampling and reduced measurement noise; the second provides a Low Resolution Mode that is fully backward-compatible with the historical reference altimetry measurements, allowing a complete inter-calibration between the state-of-the-art data and the historical record. A three-channel Advanced Microwave Radiometer for Climate (AMR-C) provides measurements of atmospheric water vapour to mitigate degradation of the radar altimeter measurements. The main data products are explained and preliminary in-orbit Poseidon-4 altimeter data performance data are presented that demonstrate the altimeter to be performing within expectations.Y	[Donlon, Craig J.; Cullen, Robert; Giulicchi, Luisella; Vuilleumier, Pierrik; Francis, C.

J	Zhan, P; Zhu, WQ; Li, N				Zhan, Pei; Zhu, Wenquan; Li, Nan			An automated rice mapping method based on flooding signals in synthetic aperture radar time series	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Rice; Mapping; Sentinel-1; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR); China	LAND-COVER CLASSIFICATION; PLANTING AREA; CHINA; IMAGERY; WATER; PRODUCTIVITY; AGRICULTURE; CHALLENGES; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS	Paddy rice is one of the most important staple foods in the world, feeding over 50% of the global population. A quick and accurate mapping of the extent of paddy rice is of critical importance for ensuring food security, studying climate change and monitoring water resources. Based on Sentinel-1A data and rice flooding features, we proposed a rice mapping method called the Automated Rice Mapping using Synthetic Aperture Radar Flooding Signals (ARM-SARFS), in which the key "V" shaped feature in the Sentinel-1A VH backscatter time series rising from the flooding before and after rice transplanting was used for rice mapping. The ARM-SARFS was validated at three study sites in Hubei, Liaoning and Guangdong provinces in China under different rice cropping systems and different geographical and climate conditions. The results showed that even without any training samples, the ARM-SARFS was able to provide a satisfying classification result with an overall accuracy of over 86% and an F-1 score of over 0.85 at all three study sites. With the aid of training samples, the classification performance increased further. When compared with the previously proposed Sentinel-1-based rice mapping methods, the ARM-SARFS improved the overall accuracy by 13.3-37.2%, and the most significant improvement was in the producer's accuracy. The sensitivity test showed that the ARM-SARFS is not sensitive to thresholding, and a high classification accuracy can be achieved at thresholds ranging from -0.025 to 0. These results demonstrated the robustness of ARM-SARFS for automated rice mapping with a high accuracy at large scales.

J	Su, X; Wang, LC; Zhang, M; Qin, WM; Bilal, M				Su, Xin; Wang, Lunche; Zhang, Ming; Qin, Wenmin; Bilal, Muhammad			A High-Precision Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (HiPARA) for Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) data: Development and verification	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Himawari-8; Land general aerosol (LaGA) algorithm; Aerosol type; HiPARA; BRDF	OPTICAL DEPTH; DARK TARGET; MODIS; LAND; VALIDATION; INVERSION; NETWORK; AERONET; VERSION; IMPACT	Due to the complexity of land cover and aerosol types, the high-precision retrieval of land aerosol properties is challenging. A land general aerosol (LaGA) algorithm called the High-Precision Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (HiPARA) is proposed for the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) sensor over East Asia. In this algorithm, a monthly spectral base reflectance ratio library was constructed to obtain a pixel-by-pixel spectral reflectance relationship model. Statistical methods were used to obtain aerosol types in China, and a linearization scheme for the aerosol types was proposed based on sensitivity analysis. Based on these techniques, HiPARA achieved a completely dynamic determination of the surface reflectance and aerosol types. The new multiband aerosol characteristic retrieval strategy can return two parameters, aerosol optical depth (AOD) and single scattering albedo (SSA). The AOD retrieved from HiPARA showed high consistency with AERONET AOD measurements, with correlation coefficients (R) of 0.939, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.082, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.113, ratios that meet an expected error (EE) of 0.825, and ratios that meet a Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) error of 0.339. Comparison of the HiPARA retrieved AOD with other operational aerosol products revealed that the accuracy of the HiPARA product was better than those of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) product (R < 0.9, RMSE > 0.175), Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) products (Dark Target (DT) algorithm, R = 0.907, RMSE = 0.203; Deep Blue (DB) algorithm, R = 0.909, RMSE = 0.139) and Visible/Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) AERDB product (R = 0.932, RMSE = 0.117). The HiPARA fitting line was close to 1:1 (i.e., y = x). The aerosol products were further evaluated for four extreme aerosol events: a smoke aerosol event, a haze aerosol event, a dust aerosol event, and a continuous aerosol variation event. Observation of the true-color images and AOD retrievals showed that the HiPARA AOD distribution matched the true-color images very well. The JAXA product had abnormal values and spatial discontinuities. The MODIS and VIIRS products were not as good as the HiPARA product in terms of spatial coverage. In the application to continuous monitoring of a dust event, the HiPARA AOD captured the variations in and intensity of the dust aerosols very well. These results suggested the robustness of HiPARA and its potential for monitoring extreme pollution events with high precision and high temporal resolution.

Notably, the time-series vegetation trends vary unevenly over time. However, conventional linear methods based on the stationarity assumption, cannot detect the implicit characteristics of nonlinear and gradual vegetation changes. Meanwhile, characterizing the inherent features of nonlinearity and nonstationarity of climatic drivers remains a challenge. This study applied multidimensional ensemble empirical mode decomposition (MEEMD) and Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend (BEAST) algorithm to diagnose spatiotemporal evolution and abrupt change in vegetation secular trends based on normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data of the Hexi Corridor during 1982-2015. Geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) was used to address the spatiotemporal nonlinearity and nonstationarity of climatic drivers. A wide range of browning trends gradually evolved into greening trends from 1982 to 2015. Compared with ordinary least squares regression, MEEMD could adaptively decompose short-term trends of noise and seasonality and elucidate the entire evolutionary process of NDVI trends. Browning trends prevailed before abrupt changes, and greening trends widely expanded after 2006 due to drought before and intense precipitation during this year. GTWR addressed the nonequilibrium effect of the time dimension on climate drivers, and the R-squared achieved 0.86. The response processes between vegetation and climatic drivers showed significant spatiotemporal nonstationarity and aggregation characteristics based on three-dimensional visualization. In addition to the drivers of temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, and potential evapotranspiration, the drying effect and mechanical stimuli of wind speed on vegetation could not be underestimated. This study provides a novel framework to solve nonlinearity and nonstationarity problems related to vegetation trends and their response mechanisms and promotes the application of remote sensing to solve practical problems.

Since 2017, Sentinel-2A/B provide multispectral time series with global coverage at an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. This is a new opportunity for mapping tree species over large areas that has not yet been fully explored. Because of the high spatial and temporal resolution, Sentinel-2 time series improve the characterization of vegetation phenology and canopy structure, parameters that are intrinsically linked to tree species. The objective of this study was to test the utility of a Sentinel-2 time-series based approach for mapping tree species in a temperate forest region in Central Europe. Using stand-wise forest inventory data for single species stands we assess how well main and minor tree species can be mapped, and if the addition of environmental variables and spatial texture metrics improves the classification accuracy. Our time series approach utilizes all available Sentinel-2 observations and an ensemble of radial basis convolution filters to build cloud-free 5-day time series for each spectral band. The time series are then used as input features to classify seventeen tree species. Our results show the potential of Sentinel-2 time-series based classification, but they also show the challenges associated with mapping a diverse portfolio of tree species. Accuracy of the nine main species, with an area proportion greater than 0.5%, ranged between 98.9% and 66.8%, which is promising for a large area. Adding detailed environmental data and texture metrics to the spectral model only marginally increased the accuracy of a few minor tree species. Overall, the eight minor tree species with area proportions less than 0.5% were most strongly affected by classification errors. Although the absolute mapped area of minor species correlated well with the estimated reference area, the small class areas of minor species lead to high classification errors in relative terms. Mapping minor tree species is challenging for statistical reasons (i.e., class imbalance, small sample size and class variance). Using all available Sentinel-2 data allows building dense time series at high spatial resolution that are mandatory for improved tree species mapping. We were able to show that the spectral time series is the prime explanatory information, even when complementing our analyses with texture information and various environmental data. The results suggest that with the applied data harmonization approach precise regional tree species mapping is feasible.

J	Moon, M; Richardson, AD; Friedl, MA				Moon, Minkyu; Richardson, Andrew D.; Friedl, Mark A.			Multiscale assessment of land surface phenology from harmonized Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2, PlanetScope, and PhenoCam imagery	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Land surface phenology; Vegetation indices; Landsat; EVI2; Sentinel-2; PlanetScope; PhenoCam	DIGITAL REPEAT PHOTOGRAPHY; FOREST PHENOLOGY; TIME-SERIES; COVER DYNAMICS; MODIS; VIIRS; CLASSIFICATION; TEMPERATE; AUTUMN; INDEX	As the spatial and temporal resolution of remotely sensed imagery has improved over the last four decades, algorithms for monitoring and mapping seasonal changes in surface properties have evolved rapidly. Most recently, the availability of daily PlanetScope imagery has created new opportunities for monitoring the land surface phenology (LSP) of terrestrial ecosystems at high spatial resolution. However, the quality and value of LSP information from PlanetScope imagery have not been systematically examined. In this paper, we evaluate the character and quality of LSP information derived from PlanetScope by comparing time series of vegetation indices and LSP metrics from PlanetScope to corresponding time series and LSP metrics derived from Harmonized Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 (HLS) imagery and PhenoCams at six sites that span a diverse range of land cover types and climate. Results show that vegetation index time series from all three data sources show high temporal correlation, and LSP metrics derived from HLS, PlanetScope, and PhenoCam show high agreement with negligible bias. Semi-variograms for phenometrics estimated from PlanetScope imagery indicate that the majority of spatial variance captured in PlanetScope phenometrics occurs well below the spatial resolution HLS imagery. At the same time, LSP metrics from HLS are most strongly correlated with the 50-75% quantiles of 3 m LSP metrics from PlanetScope. This indicates that HLS captures the average phenology at sub-pixel scale captured in PlanetScope imagery. Our results represent the first comprehensive comparison of LSP metrics estimated from PlanetScope and publicly available moderate spatial resolution imagery, and provide insights regarding: (1) the quality and character of LSP metrics derived from HLS and PlanetScope; and (2) the relative merits and trade-offs associated with the use of each data source for LSP studies.

However, monitoring the spatial and temporal variability in forest flowering at landscape scales is challenging (e.g. current monitoring is often highly localized and in-situ or for single dates). This study presents a method that combines drone and satellite images (PlanetScope) that can produce landscape-scale maps of flowering dynamics. This method is demonstrated in forest landscapes dominated by the eucalypt Corymbia calophylla (red gum or marri) in Western Australia. Dronederived images of flowering eucalypt canopies, available for restricted temporal and spatial extents, are used to label satellite image pixels with the proportion of a pixel footprint that is flowering. The pixels labelled with flowering proportion, the response variable, are combined with various metrics that characterize time series of spectral indices sensitive to the presence of green vegetation and cream-colored flowers, the predictor variables. A machine learning model then predicts daily pixel-level flowering proportions. The model is trained with data from two sites and is tested with data from three sites and various dates throughout the Corymbia calophylla season. The model is able to accurately predict pixel-level flowering proportion throughout the flowering season (RMSE <4% across all sites and dates), across sites with dense to sparse canopy, different background soil covers, and is robust to not detecting false positive flowering when no flowering events are occurring. Due to the spatiotemporal coverage of satellite images, this model can be deployed to generate regional maps of flowering dynamics in forest ecosystems that can be used for monitoring forest ecosystem condition and supporting research into drivers of eucalypt forest phenology.

Widely used indicators to assess the efficiency and sustainability of settlement development are the compactness and density of the built-up area. However, at global scale, a temporally consistent and spatially detailed survey of the distribution and concentration of the building stock - meaning the total area and volume of buildings within a defined spatial unit or settlement, commonly referred to as building density - does not yet exist. To fill this data and knowledge gap, an approach was developed to map key characteristics of the world's building stock in a so far unprecedented level of spatial detail for every single settlement on our planet. The resulting World Settlement Footprint 3D dataset quantifies the fraction, total area, average height, and total volume of buildings for a measuring grid with 90 m cell size. The World Settlement Footprint 3D is generated using a modified version of the World Settlement Footprint human settlements mask derived from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery at 10 m spatial resolution, in combination with 12 m digital elevation data and radar imagery collected by the TanDEM-X mission. The underlying, automated processing framework includes three basic workflows: one estimating the mean building height based on an analysis of height differences along potential building edges, a second module determining the building fraction and total building area within each 90 m cell, and a third part combining the height information and building area in order to determine the average height and total built-up volume at 90 m gridding. Optionally, a simple 3D building model (level of detail 1) can be generated for regions where data on the building footprints is available. A comprehensive validation campaign based on 3D building models obtained for 19 regions (similar to 86,000 km(2)) and street-view samples indicating the number of floors for >130,000 individual buildings in 15 additional cities documents that the novel World Settlement Footprint 3D data provides valuable and, for the first time, globally consistent information on key characteristics of the building stock in both, large urban agglomerations as well as small-scale rural settlements. Thus, the new dataset represents a promising baseline dataset for a wide range of previously impossible environmental, socioeconomic, and climatological studies worldwide.

Although numerous reconstruction methods have been developed, they have not effectively addressed the issues associated with large gaps in the time series over cloudy and rainy regions, due to the insufficient utilization of the spatial, temporal and periodical correlations. In this paper, an adaptive SpatioTemporal Tensor Completion method (termed ST-Tensor) method is proposed to reconstruct long-term NDVI time series in cloud-prone regions, by making full use of the multi-dimensional spatio-temporal information simultaneously. For this purpose, a highly-correlated tensor is built by considering the correlations among the spatial neighbors, inter-annual variations, and periodic characteristics, in order to reconstruct the missing information via an adaptive-weighted low-rank tensor completion model. An iterative l1 trend filtering method is then implemented to eliminate the residual temporal noise. This new method was tested using MODIS 16-day composite NDVI products from 2001 to 2018 obtained in Mainland Southeast Asia, where the rainy climate commonly induces large gaps and noise in the data. The qualitative and quantitative results indicate that the ST Tensor method is more effective than the five previous methods in addressing the different missing data problems, especially the temporally continuous gaps and spatio-temporally continuous gaps. It is also shown that the ST-Tensor method performs better than the other methods in tracking NDVI seasonal trajectories, and is therefore a superior option for generating high-quality long-term NDVI time series for cloud-prone regions.

Accurate measurements of urban morphological and demographic figures are at the core of many international endeavors to address issues of urbanization, such as the United Nations' call for "Sustainable Cities and Communities". In many countries - particularly developing countries -, however, this database does not yet exist. Here, we demonstrate a novel deep learning and big data analytics approach to fuse freely available global radar and multi-spectral satellite data, acquired by the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites. Via this approach, we created the first-ever global and quality controlled urban local climate zones classification covering all cities across the globe with a population greater than 300,000 and made it available to the community (https://doi.org/10.14459/2021mp1633461). Statistical analysis of the data quantifies a global inequality problem: approximately 40% of the area defined as compact or light/large low-rise accommodates about 60% of the total population, whereas approximately 30% of the area defined as sparsely built accommodates only about 10% of the total population. Beyond, patterns of urban morphology were discovered from the global classification map, confirming a morphologic relationship to the geographical region and related cultural heritage. We expect the open access of our dataset to encourage research on the global change process of urbanization, as a multidisciplinary crowd of researchers will use this baseline for spatial perspective in their work. In addition, it can serve as a unique dataset for stakeholders such as the United Nations to improve their spatial assessments of urbanization.

Sentinel-1 soil moisture at 1 km resolution: a validation study	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Soil moisture; High resolution; Sentinel-1; Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR); Spatial representativeness error (SRE); Validation	BAND SAR DATA; TIME-SERIES; TEMPORAL STABILITY; LINEAR-REGRESSION; SPATIAL SCALES; SURFACE; RADAR; RETRIEVAL; CLIMATE; VARIABILITY	This study presents an assessment of a pre-operational soil moisture product at 1 km resolution derived from satellite data acquired by the European Radar Observatory Sentinel-1 (S-1), representing the first space component of the Copernicus program. The product consists of an estimate of surface soil volumetric water content Theta [m(3)/m(3)] and its uncertainty [m(3)/m(3)], both at 1 km. The retrieval algorithm relies on a time series based Short Term Change Detection (STCD) approach, taking advantage of the frequent revisit of the S-1 constellation that performs C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging. The performance of the S-1 Theta product is estimated through a direct comparison between 1068 S-1 Theta images against in situ Theta measurements acquired by 167 ground stations located in Europe, America and Australia, over 4 years between January 2015 and December 2020, depending on the site. The paper develops a method to estimate the spatial representativeness error (SRE) that arises from the mismatch between the S-1 Theta retrieved at 1 km resolution and the in situ point-scale Theta observations. The impact of SRE on standard validation metrics, i.e., root mean square error (RMSE), Pearson correlation (R) and linear regression, is quantified and experimentally assessed using S-1 and ground Theta data collected over a dense hydrologic network (4-5 stations/km(2)) located in the Apulian Tavoliere (Southern Italy). Results show that for the dense hydrological network the RMSE and correlation are similar to 0.06 m(3)/m(3) and 0.71, respectively, whereas for the sparse hydrological networks, i.e., 1 station/km(2), the SRE increases the RMSE by similar to 0.02 m(3)/m(3) (70% Confidence Level). Globally, the S-1 Theta product is characterized by an intrinsic (i.e., with SRE removed) RMSE of similar to 0.07 m(3)/m(3) over the Theta range [0.03, 0.60] m(3)/m(3) and R of 0.54. A breakdown of the RMSE per dry, medium and wet Theta ranges is also derived and its implications for setting realistic requirements for SAR-based Theta retrieval are discussed together with recommendations for the density of in situ Theta observations.

A million kernels of truth: Insights into scalable satellite maize yield mapping and yield gap analysis from an extensive ground dataset in the US Corn	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Crop yields; US Corn Belt; Landsat; Agricultural monitoring	LEAF-AREA INDEX; VEGETATION INDEXES; SOLAR-RADIATION; UNITED-STATES; TIME-SERIES; CROP; LANDSAT; LEVEL; MODEL; WHEAT	Crop yield maps estimated from satellite data increasingly are used to understand drivers of yield trends and variability, yet satellite-derived regional maps are rarely compared with location-specific yields due to the difficulty of acquiring sub-field ground truth data at scale. In commercial agricultural systems, combine harvesters with onboard yield monitors collect real-time yield data during harvest with high spatial resolution, generating a large ground dataset. Here, we leveraged a yield monitor dataset of over one million maize field observations across the United States Corn Belt from 2008 to 2018 to evaluate the Scalable Crop Yield Mapper (SCYM). SCYM uses region-specific crop model simulations and climate data to interpret vegetation indices from satellite observations, thus enabling efficient sub-field yield estimation across large regions and multiple years without reliance on ground data calibration. We used the ground dataset to compare alternative SCYM model implementations, define minimum required satellite observation criteria, and evaluate the sensitivity of satellite-based yield estimates to on-the-ground variation in management, soil, and annual weather. We found that smoothing annual time series data with harmonic regression increased 30 m pixel-level accuracy from r(2) = 0.31 to 0.40 and reduced dependency on specific satellite observation timing, enabling robust yield estimation on 97% of annual maize area using only Landsat data. Agreement improved as the assessment was aggregated to field-level (r2 = 0.45) and county-level (r(2) = 0.69) scales, demonstrating the need for fine-resolution ground truth data to better assess sub-field level accuracy in high resolution products. We found that SCYM and ground data showed a similar yield response to management and environmental variation, particularly capturing linear and nonlinear responses to sowing density, soil water holding capacity, and growing season precipitation. However, sensitivity to factors like soil quality and planting date was muted for SCYM estimates compared to ground-based yields. Random forest models were able to match SCYM performance when trained on at least 1000 ground observations, but performed poorly when tested on years and locations not represented in the training data. Our results demonstrate that satellite yield maps can provide much-needed information on multidecadal yield trends and inform yield gap analyses.

Spaceborne light detection and ranging (lidar) platforms, especially the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) and Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS), can measure forest canopy height in discrete footprints globally. Their coverage provides a promising data source for national to global-scale forest canopy height estimates. However, previous studies usually used a regression-based approach to develop spatially continuous forest canopy height distribution through the aid of optical images, which cannot take full advantage of the dense spaceborne lidar footprints and may still suffer from the saturation effect of optical images. In this study, we developed a novel neural network guided interpolation (NNGI) method to map forest canopy height by fusing GEDI, ICESat-2 ATLAS, and Sentinel-2 images. To evaluate the performance of the proposed NNGI method, we generated a 30-m forest canopy height product of China for the year 2019. More than 140 km2 drone-lidar data were collected across the country to train and validate the NNGI method. The results showed that the average forest canopy height of China is 15.90 m with a standard deviation of 5.77 m. We evaluated the interpolated forest canopy height product of China by over 1,100,000 GEDI validation footprints (R2 = 0.55, RMSE = 5.32 m), about 33 km2 drone-lidar validation data (R2 = 0.58, RMSE = 4.93 m), and over 59,000 field plot measurements (R2 = 0.60, RMSE = 4.88 m). Benefiting from the interpolation-based mapping strategy, the resulting product had almost no saturation effect in areas with tall forest canopies. The high mapping accuracy demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed NNGI method for monitoring spatially continuous forest canopy height at national to global scales by integrating multi-platform spaceborne lidar data and optical images, enabling opportunities to provide more accurate quantification of terrestrial carbon storage and better understanding of forest ecosystem processes.

Multi-layer high-resolution soil moisture estimation using machine learning over the United States	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Soil moisture; SMAP; Microwave remote sensing; Rootzone soil moisture; Multi-layer soil moisture; Machine learning	NEAR-SURFACE; IN-SITU; EXPONENTIAL FILTER; DOWNSCALING APPROACH; SPATIAL VARIABILITY; SMAP MISSION; 4 DECADES; ASSIMILATION; PRODUCT; MODEL	The lack of proper understanding of multi-layer soil moisture (SM) profile (signals) remains a persistent challenge in sustainable agricultural water management and food security, especially during drought conditions. We develop a machine-learning algorithm using the concept of learning from patterns to estimate the multi-layer SM information in ungauged locations firmly based on local knowledge of the climatic and landscape controls. The Contiguous United States (CONUS) is clustered into homogeneous regions based on the association between SM and climate and landscape controls. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm is applied to homogenous regions to capture the complex relationship between appropriate predictor variables and in-situ SM at multiple layers over the CONUS. Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Level 4 (L4) surface (0-5 cm) and rootzone (0-100 cm) SM along with climate and landscape datasets are used as predictor variables. In-situ multi-layer SM recorded by Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN), Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL), and U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN) networks are utilized as predictands. XGBoost models are then trained region-wise and layer-wise to estimate multi-layer SM information at 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 cm depths (five layers) at 1-km spatial resolution. Results indicate that the predictor variables have varying levels of influence on SM with changing soil depth, and meteorological variables have the least importance. Validation at 79 independent locations indicates the multi-layer SM estimates successfully capture temporal dynamics of SM, with most locations achieving ubRMSE less than 0.04 m(3)/m(3). The high-resolution SM estimates offer spatial sub-grid heterogeneity compared to SMAP L4 SM.

MISR AOD showed good agreement against AERONET AOD with 68.68% of the retrievals falling within the expected error and high Pearson?s correlation coefficient (R = 0.83). The 20 years geometric mean of MAIAC and MISR AOD revealed higher loading of aerosols over the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) and Eastern coast of India by 30% to 44% compared to the mean AOD over the entire SA. The highest mean AOD under cloud-free conditions was noted during monsoon season, followed by pre-monsoon, post-monsoon, and winter. The high contribution of coarsemode AOD (cAOD) mainly from natural aerosol emission and small-mode AOD (sAOD) from local anthropogenic emissions are the main driver to high AOD in monsoon and pre-monsoon seasons. Besides, the presence of high humidity during the monsoon season favors the hygroscopic growth of the particles and leads to higher AOD values over SA. The high spatial resolutions of MODIS/MAIAC and MISR aerosol products enabled the identification of previously unobserved aerosol hotspots over Bihar, West Bengal, and the eastern Indian coastal state of Odisha, which is mainly dominated by small aerosol particles. The contributions of smaller aerosol particles to the total aerosol loading were found to be higher during post-monsoon and winter over most states in India, Nepal, and Bangladesh. In contrast, the contribution of coarser particles was higher over Pakistan during premonsoon and monsoon seasons. Smaller particles were predominantly retrieved over the Indian states dominated by mining industries, including Jharkhand and Odisha. A typical dominance of absorbing carbonaceous aerosols was also noted over the northwestern region of IGP during post-monsoon, which otherwise was mainly affected by mixed dust aerosols and carbonaceous aerosols in pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons. A statistically significant positive temporal trend in AOD was observed for the whole study period, over most of the SA region, which was influenced by the increase in small particles over India and Bangladesh. Urban/industrial weakly absorbing aerosols were found to be the main contributor to a similarly positive trend over Central India and East coast Indian states. Overall, recent advancements in high spatial resolution satellite-based aerosol optical properties showed good potential to identify the aerosol hotspots and constrain aerosol types across a highly polluted SA region.
